It's what you call people when you live in a slavic country that is also impoverished and unproductive but you want to deflect it by talking about how hard you are.

Family/innocent man did nothing wrong.

Cop fucked up, lost his composure and killed an innocent and unarmed person.

There is a massive difference there. I do not feel sorry for the cop, hard to find sympathy for a person so reckless with human life. Especially when they are extensively trained to do the opposite...the cop should feel like shit, he recklessly killed an innocent person. He's not fit to be a police officer. This innocent and unarmed man answered his door and was killed on his own door-step. I feel like I'm repeating myself here, but I really can't understand how you (1) blame the caller more than the cops for this man's death and (2) seem to have equal sympathy for the cop who recklessly killed someone and the family of said victim...

Your comment from above:

&gt; My real issue is that people are blaming this cop just as much (if not more than) the person that caused this situation. 

Would imply that you place more blame of killing an innocent man on a random person calling in a threat than a police officer who is supposedly trained to follow procedures and maintain composure in tense situations. Your expectations of the police are far too low and it is a significant part of the problem with policing in this country. The police need to be held to an exceptionally high standard. Too many times have innocent and unarmed people been unnecessarily killed by police. They are not held accountable for their actions. Things need to change. We don't need people feeling sorry for a cop who lost his cool and killed someone. Your unwarranted (in my opinion) sympathy for the cop would lead me to believe you have some sort of bias. I don't expect you to admit it, but it wouldn't surprise me if you or someone you are close to is involved with law enforcement. That's the only way I can wrap my head around your logic here...

The cop belongs in hell, the family does not. That should sum everything up nicely. It's not exclusionary, but there's nuance to it. Are you too dense to understand that? "They both probably feel bad right now" doesn't sit well with me because the cop is one who caused the death in the first place. If the cop wasn't a complete fucking idiot, there is no problem here. There is no innocent dead man and grieving family.

If someone was raped, do you say "oh well the rapist is in hell, we shouldn't drag him down any further"? I understand this wasn't a rape, but I exaggerate the situation in a hope to demonstrate the issue I take with your overly sympathetic viewpoint towards to the cop. Sure, with rape you assume there is intent by the perpetrator to harm the victim. Is that the case here? We don't know. I'm sure there are cops out there itching to kill someone given the opportunity. Maybe it was a combination of awful composure and trigger finger. That video of Arizona cops killing man literally crawling on the ground begging not be killed should be an indication that there are bloodthirsty cops out there with little to no regard for human life. 

Either way, opinions like yours creates opportunities for these kinds of things to continue. Until we as a society hold police more accountable for their actions, this kind of shit will continue. They need better screening protocols, more training, etc...Most of all, these cops should be charged with a crime, they are trusted to handle these situations professionally. How many innocent people need be killed before something more drastic takes place?

&gt;1.) I realize that my particular point of view is not very widespread as far as the term 'gatekeeping' goes. It's a fairly new term. Should this mean my opinion doesn't matter?

Well, it means that your opinion *in fact* doesn't matter to the vast majority of people who play and make video games, which is what I have been trying to tell you with the basketball analogy.  You will have absolutely no problem finding video games and video game communities that cater to your weird ideas.  In fact, I imagine you have disproportionately many games and communities that cater to your sensitivities.  So why, when you find something that does not, can't you just say "OK, this for different people with different sensibilities" and move on?  

In other words, where did you get the idea that there is "A" gaming community and that it can/will/should conform to your standards?  Why can't League of Legends be that caustic shithole for people who like to scream at each other, and then people like you play some other game that isn't that way? 

&gt; If most people don't know about the view I hold, then isn't it even more important that I share it?

Sure, that's why members of all religions preach. I think if there was somebody here demanding that depictions of meat-eating or criticizing Islam were removed from all video games, you would instantly see my point.  The rebuttal of "Not everybody who plays video games is going to be a vegan/Muslim" would come to your lips unbidden.  That is what I am saying to you. 
 
&gt; But isn't that normally considered poor sportsmanship? 

Is *what* considered poor sportsmanship?  Making fun of other teams and players on a subreddit?  I still don't know what you're talking about; the examples you've given are a video game calling you a baby for picking an easy difficulty, and people on a subreddit.  

&gt;But the level of hostility you think goes into competitive communities is in direct contrast to my personal experience with groups outside the gaming community.

Do you think gamers in the middle of an e-sports league game in front of audiences behave any better or worse than professional baseball players and etc.?  I keep trying to pin you don't but you won't compare apples to apples.  Do you think that online communities about sports and such don't have people carrying on like they do here? 

Or better yet, do you think when a bunch of guys are playing stickball in the street and there's no coach around to enforce etiquette, they all say 'please' and 'thank you' and the losers shake the winner's hands when they're done?

&gt; Fair, you could say opposition to Nazism is not an ideology. 

There's no 'you could say' about it. Opposition to Nazism isn't an ideology.  

&gt;I guess I'm also confused when you just flatly say that I don't know what I'm talking about, what Nazism means, and what it means to be a good man.

 I don't know how I could make it more clear.   You're sitting in a chair whining that a video game teasing you is akin to Nazism. I am pointing out to you that the people *who actually fought Nazis in real life* certainly behaved in a similar fashion.  You'd doing the 'Everything I don't like is Nazism' thing in other words. 

&gt;You seem to think I consider many things that I don't akin to Nazism and I'm not sure where you got that from.

Because you brought it up specifically to say that.  Right before you walked it back because it looked ridiculous, which was right before you insinuated it again.  There is *no conflict* between opposing Nazis, and ribbing people about their masculinity. It's slimy for you to say otherwise. 

&gt; I would disagree that casual gamers don't exist.

Of course they exist. I'm saying they don't participate "In the gaming community" in any meaningful way, and thus aren't "persecuted by hardcore gamers" in any meaningful way.  The *exception being* video game journalists like the one this thread is about, because they are essentially casuals forced to engage the community more than they otherwise would. 

&gt; would still end up on forums from time to time, statistically. 

Sure, and some small percentage of the time that small percentage of people might catch some ribbing from hardcore gamers. *AND*?  Most likely the hardcore gamer is catching shit *all the fucking time* out in the real world for his primary hobby being something 'for kids', and hell, even on the internet communities, it's the casuals who through the first stone often enough with jibes about how "Some of us have better things to do than play games" or comments about people's mothers basements. 

You are focusing on a problem that doesn't exist, and pretending it's one-sided when it's not. 

&gt; Also, you say "we" when referring to getting on journalists' cases. Are you part of a specific group that targets journalists or are you saying "we" to make your specific viewpoint seem bigger?

No, I've been in GamerGate since the beginning. That's why I actually know something about games journalism, gaming culture, and how full of crap you are. 

&gt; Encouragement and practice make for better athletes, not slurs and derogatory comments, at least not for the majority. T

I'm not talking about better athletes, I'm talking about better *men*.  Nobody benefits from a generation of males growing up who are preoccupied with 'gatekeeping' and who make a living crying on the internet because a video game insulted them. 

&gt;https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/02/25/the-one-true-way

Throw 10 complete strangers of varying skill levels into 2 teams and force them to play against each other with no coach or referee policing behavior- any sport you want- and tell me the fifth wheel on the team won't catch shit.  Sure, the anonymity of the internet amplifies the effect a bit over what would happen in real life, but 'as a coach' you should be able to see what I'm talking about. 

 I realize that comic tells you what you want to hear, but as somebody who actually played League of Legends for years,  believe me when I tell you that for every hardcore player yelling "Get good faggot scrub" when people mess up, there are two casuals yelling "It's just a game, faggot tryhard" and throwing games on purpose when they get bored or start to lose. 

*It goes both ways*.   It's just people being people.

&gt; Yet nobody's been able to say where it's wrong. It's almost as if people are just downvoting because they don't like the comment.

"I'm not wrong, I'm totally providing flawless arugments, its everybody else that's wrong!"

That doesn't sound delusional at all....

&gt;We've also had no terrorist attacks since 2007

That'll change real quick if your island keeps importing migrants. 

&gt;My point is more that Americans are far less likely to leave their country

Okay. And?

&gt;so I doubt you're in a good position to comment on what's happening in other countries.

And yet you are? What sort of double standards are you operating on?

&gt;When was the last time you were in the UK?


2008, What's the point? When was the last time you came to the US? Have you ever left your country? England doesn't count. Are *you* able to comment on other countries you never went to?

Well good thing I'm not an idiot like you because you DON'T have to go to a country to formulate an opinion or pontificate if what that country's policies are right or wrong. I don't have to go to Venezuela to know that it is a hellhole. I don't have to go to South Africa to know whites are being persecuted. I don't have to go to Sweden to know there are no go zones. I don't have to go to France to know there are 'aesthetic' barriers for peoples protection against terrorists.

You could argue "well its just media lies" yet I too can argue the same thing for you, so it would be a moot point. 

&gt;Well done on comparing a country of 323.1 million to a continent of 743.1 million.

I didn't. The terrorists attacks happening in Europe aren't created by citizens, dumb dumb. 


&gt;How many mass shootings have there been this month?

Apparently a shooting of 1 with fatality of 0 counts as a mass shooting. I guess if I shoot my non existent gun in the air it counts as a 'mass shooting.'



Btw, most of those 'mass shootings' happen in big liberal cities with heavy gun laws. 

&gt;The gun laws are working!

I know you're trying to mock me but FYI I'm against heavy gun regulations since it doesn't apply to criminals. Nice try tho, mimicry is the highest form of flattery they say.


By the way, I don't think you guys are allowed to be smug about gun violence if acid attacks are on the fucking rise and happening almost daily on your island.

&gt;It has now emerged that the incidents of acid attacks are not recorded in Scotland, making it difficult to gauge the extent of the problem.

Good job Scotland. 

Huh, turns out if you ban and dump all the guns into the ocean people will find other ways to kill other people through other means without fear of retribution, imagine that. 

Thank god those rape gangs in the UK don't have guns, amiright? 

&gt;I never said total Americans, you inferred that.

You said "6% of your own citizens." Which, without specifying a cap, imples 6% of our total citizens. You can argue semantics all you want, because that's all you have, but you can't weasel out of this one. You fucked up, just admit it. Unless you want to admit you were trying to be deceptive. So pick one.

Also, you guys really can't talk on kids who fail geography when you have [a Uk born rapper that thinks England is a city.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/england-is-my-city)

Nevermind the fact your island is infested with chavs that can barely locate where the island is they're living on or anything else for that matter.



&gt;You obviously don't know what battered wife syndrome is.

&gt;&gt;proceeds to link something different.

Well, we already know you're not the brightest bulb in the room. 

Huge difference between the case of Battered Women Syndrome(UK) that you read only the top paragraph of off of wikipedia, and the medical definitions

&gt;[With battered woman syndrome, a woman may develop a learned helplessness that causes her to believe she deserves the abuse and that she can’t get away from it.](https://www.healthline.com/health/battered-woman-syndrome) 

&gt;Women become trapped in abusive relationships for many reasons, which can include:

&gt; * being afraid to leave

&gt; * disbelief or denial that the partner is actually abusive

&gt; * severe depression or low self-esteem that makes them think the abuse is their fault

&gt; * believing that if the abuser loves them, it’s okay, and they can change the behavior

And various other reasons why someone would stay or return to that situation. 

You get your ass verbally kicked and you come back for more like its a guilty pleasure. You trying so hard to be specific with it just makes you come off as an autistic spud.

&gt; Let me see if I got this correctly.

Chances are you don't. But let's take a whack at it.
 
&gt; So I can call the police, 

That's what 911 is for.

&gt; give them a random address 

This wasn't a random address. The 'swatter' knew the address, he knew who this guy was and who he lived with.

&gt; and some made up emergency, 

Well. If you have a phone and working vocal chords, then yes. You certainly can do this.

&gt; and I can just sit at home eating coconut betting there's a chance a person's going to be killed?

I suppose you could. It would mean you are a complete psycho. Judging by how scared you say you are... I would rule out you lacking basic human empathy.

&gt; Who does that? Who calls the police? 

We won't really know until (or should I say UNLESS) the police release the full details. It's a catch-22 for them.

Refuse to release the full details of how this happened = get accused of hiding something = public outrage, protests etc.

Release the full details and you aren't making it any harder for another piece of shit to do this. It's like... you don't want the whole world to know how the bank robbers got away or the recipe for the bomb the Boston Marathon asshole set off.

&gt; Also isn't SWAT supposed to be some kind of high-end professionals? 

Generally. Yes. Veteran Officers with tons of high-risk experience. Military Veterans (former MP's, snipers etc). You don't just do exceptionally well in the academy, have good test results and weapon accuracy and get an invite to be a super cop. Major departments use these teams for very specialized, very intense situations. They need reliable, stable people behind the helm of those units. It's the civillian law enforcement version of Special Forces.

&gt; Will I get shot if I open door and see a police officer in front of me? 

HIGHLY fucking unlikely. Does it happen? Yup. Can you get killed by a falling screwdriver dropped by a construction worker? Yup. Matter of a fact, a falling hammer is MUCH more likely to kill you than a cop (unless you are the type to fight with them). This kind of thing is so rare you have a better chance of a unicorn giving you cancer and a million dollars on the same day.

&gt; Do people here just accept the idea that you get killed if a police visits you?

Do you even read current news? Even if it's just the headlines??? - People are literally rioting in the streets over police shootings. Whether they are justified shootings or not. people are really pissed. Oh and only if it's a black guy.

Point is. People are accepting less and less when it comes to law enforcement overstepping their boundaries and taking things into their own hands.

Also. This guy didn't just open his door and get shot. The police received a call that a man in that house was armed, had already killed his father and was holding his mother and children hostage at gunpoint. This, of course, was false. 

But put yourself in the shoes of the person holding the gun in this particular instance. Thje shoes of the guy who knows one wrong decision means he might not get to go home and see his wife and kids ever again. Trust me. Criminals (of all colors) kill cops much more frequently than the cops kill an innocent person.

So, in this case, they are told by dispatch that a crazy motherfucker with a gun has killed his father and threatening to kill his mother and sibling. The suspect currently armed and NOT going to put his gun down. 

If they weren't given a physical description by the 'swatter' - I'm going to guess the SWAT Team still knew what this guy looked like by searching for him in their database.

So, when the 'suspect' opens the door, the Officer make a split-second decision. Do I go home and see my family? Do I stop this psycho from killing more people? When I say split second decision. These Officers are being told he is armed with a handgun. Most pistols fire at a speed of 3 to 5 football fields per second. Not a lot of time to think about all of your other options.

Could they have handled it differently? You can always rewind a situation and reflect on what could be done differently. But there is a lot we don't know yet. As far as I know, they haven't released the first call. Was he holding something in his hand? Something shiny and black or silver like a phone or even a camera? If he was just curious about the commotion and trying to film or take pics, perhaps it could have been pointed in their general direction.

It's not like this cop woke up with a hard dick for killing someone today. Especially not an innocent person. 

&gt; I am freaking out a little, 

It's your right to. However, you have to put this into context. This is probably the rarest form of a police shooting. Much more likely to choke to death on dodo bird hot wings.

&gt; probably because I didn't have enough sleep. 

And because news outlets don't sell papers, they don't get clicks or shares and they don't make ad revenue by selling a fair and accurate portrayal of the news. They make their money by creating fear, outrage, unhappiness and selling headlines with sensationalism.

&gt; But I don't feel safe; I don't want to get killed.

Here's a tip or 30. 

* Don't be a prick to strangers online. A handful of them can and will pull your info and do various things to fuck with you. This is an exceptionally rare way to do it. But it happens. 

* Keep your info safe. Use social media / gaming usernames that have nothing to do with you. If I can google your /u/ and find your Facebook... you make it easier for people to take online beef into the real world. Again. Super rare. But it happens.

* [Last, but certainly not least DO NOT open the door for the police unless they have a warrant.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE) - Lying about having a search warrant is one of the few things they can not do.

No warrant? Let them blow the door off the hinges and keep your hands up if they do enter your home. When the guy opened the door, he put the cops in a strange position. They were (probably) 10 to 30 yards away from a position of cover to be safe. They were on the scene to stop a man with a gun who is killing his family. All of the sudden the door opens. So an Officer made a decision. Unfortunately, it was the wrong one.
