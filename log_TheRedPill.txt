Exactly, and the thing is that people are shaped by what they read on the sub, they try to find TRP truths, while they don't realize they also fabricate them. They force TRP on anything they remember or have interacted with, while it doesn't apply as much. It's like people who start toying with a 3D printer and suddenly believe that in several years from now, EVERYTHING will be 3D printed, which is a truckload of bullshit.

People get into something and start suffocating in it. Like someone who wants to learn to swim and just dives into the deep ocean straight away.

dont blame the red pill!! blame the blue one then yourself for not understanding something you obviously still dont.  everyone on earth should know all the things RP reveals, its not a dirty secret, its the reaction to  the real secret : how easily conditioned but powerful human minds are. 
 

 Its  not the only way to "unplug" your mind and take control of your life, btw. Its not even exactly about woman.  its about reclaiming your male brain from the crippling mental conditioning that has been forced upon you since birth by a self destructive  society of egotistical monkeys.

Protect its  reputation and ensure its legacy brothers!. 
     you sir have done the opposite here with your ignorant logic and incorrect assumptions. TRP didnt kill your friend w its Harsh Truths on womans evil snakelike ways  and The catcher in the rye wasnt too popular w jocks and phonies who picked on would be serial killers. Knowledge is amoral and evolution ensures survival. grrr

 Now, TRP is the most potent after a woman has broken your heart  so give dilluted RP advice that will help then stfu.  Information is  fluid now and anyone can get to TRP reddit. if  they take the advice, it helps and  THEY ASK,  give them the actual website of your fav RP writers. Cant go wrong w rollo tomassi,s website but you must stress "start at year 1". while its still brutal he has a great way of puttin the spoonfull of sugar in somewhere to soothe the burn.
worst case they say its bs, how could u believe any of it etc. best case they unplug themselves as they alone have that power and THEN you can tell them about this forum.
   
   otherwise stick to your (growing) new found ideas and beliefs because they feel right to you, argue tooth and nail with the facts that can be proven via any source, and agree to disagree on irrelevent subjective opinions because they are meaningless.   LEAVE TRP OUT OF IT.

TL,DR-- Met a cool woman who was in town for a week or so and set to come back permanently a couple months later. Rather than just doing my thing and hitting her up when she was back, I gave her too much attention, and she bounced before even getting back.


I just want to make this to remind you it can happen easily if you’re not careful.


Quick rundown of me. I’m naturally pretty alpha, but realized I was missing some key ingredients a while back, and am correcting the situation. I’m tall, in good shape from years of martial arts and working out, I’m really good at building things (do design-build for a living), and I have a pretty slow temper, but don’t really take shit off of people. I’m generally also the kind of guy that other guys gravitate to. I think the problem with me was I tried in my early 20s to repair my parents’ own messed up marriage via proxy with a woman that while externally attractive turned out to be batshit crazy, and basically whined and bitched her way into my letting her control me. A big result of that was I didn’t pursue my interests and career the way I wanted to, so I’m behind in that aspect. Interestingly enough, the last couple years of my 11 year marriage with her I really started to not give a fuck, started sleeping on the couch on my own, and just started doing the things I wanted to do and ignored her bitching. Even though I was faithful throughout our marriage, I started to get a lot more of female attention around that time, without really trying to. Looking back and after reading here and some other places, I realize that a large part of that was because I was taking back frame. Or maybe more that I had already left in my heart, so I had my own sense of frame again. I ceded frame to her really early in the relationship, and that is a hard if not impossible thing to ever get back. 


Anyway, fast forward. We broke up. More specifically I left. I may post more about that later, but not important now. I moved out, started working for myself, started training BJJ in earnest again, working for myself, got on Tinder and all that, started to go out, and basically started slaying pussy. It was almost too easy (I DO live in Austin, which doesn’t hurt). One of my plates ended up as a girlfriend, even though she was full of drama and was not a good catch. Super hot, top five all time fuck, but not not worth it. Was with her for a year and change, but I began screwing around, which was when I probably should have just ended things, but oh well. Anyway, that’s another segue irrelevant to my current point. But I broke up with that one about 4 months back,


Since then I’ve been back to slaying again, my business has ups and downs but is on an overall upward trajectory, I’m staying in shape, doing well, banging 8s, 9s, and 10s without too much effort. And I’ve realized that I’ve been selling myself short in the women's department, so I’ve raised my standards a lot. I only will date women that are professionals or entrepreneurs. 


Then I meet this one. My inner romantic got the best of me.


Met her on OKC before she came back to Austin to visit family and scout moving back from where she was working overseas. Just based on her profile, I thought she was a woman of unusual quality, and I was pretty excited to meet her. I thought that I probably shouldn’t sleep with her right away, but maybe feel things out a bit. But when we met I liked her even more than I thought I would. Amazingly sexy, really tall, like 6’1” (which I like because I’m 6’4”), really fun, easy to talk to. And she’s a doctor. Like, c’mon. Anyway, I take her home, the sex is incredible. We hang out and hook up a few more times before she leaves. And decide to keep seeing each other when she gets back. This is a couple months ago.


We message a few times, not too much, and they start to get a bit more serious. That’s where I fucked up. And honestly, I pretty much lost interest in the other women I’ve been sleeping with, and started to taper it off. All for a woman who HAS NOT EVEN MOVED BACK YET. Here’s the thing, I got that feeling with her that I hadn’t had since I was maybe 19. I’ve been married twice, but only felt that really light easiness with a couple of other girlfriends when I was really young.


I fucked it up by putting myself out there too much, and she freaked. Also, to be fair, she just came out of a three year relationship that seemed to end pretty badly, and women handle that stuff differently than men do.


Basically, I should have kept my mouth shut, kept banging my other plates, and just made her a plate until I found out if she’s the real deal or not.


But I put it out there too much. She literally gets back tomorrow, and we were supposed to hang out, but she sent me a message saying she thinks we want different things, and it’s probably best to end this before anyone gets led on or hurt (yeah she meant me lol).


Now the good news. I didn’t freak out or even feel that bad, just a bit of disappointment, but mostly in myself. I was just automatically starting to cede frame again, and said too much, against my better instincts. I started to give a fuck, and I realized it at the time, but I also try to be honest. That never works. BUT I didn’t get upset or mope. If anything, I thought of Jocko Willink, how he says “Good” when you face some obstacle.


It also made me realize I should keep plates going, but focus even more on my business and less on pussy. Ultimately I think I would like to settle down with one woman, but it has to be the right one (not saying this one wasn’t necessarily), and even if it is the right one you have to handle it just right and be in control at all times (which I definitely whiffed on this time).


Anyway, I’m literally just a phone call away from other hotties I can go have some fun with, so might as well do that, focus on work, and chalk it up to a lesson learned.

Agreed. Still figuring it out. I did plan to become a Marine when I was 21/22, which I don't think was a bad path to take, but I never completely committed to it or signed the contract. Living with my mom for as long as I did around that time didn't help. Even though she was supportive, it wasn't what I needed in my life. 

I think I realized something was wrong and went to focus on the wrong things to fix. 

It's like troubleshooting a problem with a car. You think you know the problem but don't properly diagnose the issue, you start replacing parts that aren't causing the problem, yet your car still has trouble starting. Eventually you get to the point where there are many quality components to the car and yet the original issue is still getting worse. 

Eventually you find the problem and everything clicks, starts running smoothly and you start rapidly accelerating.

I haven't told you what kind of advice I've taken from either of them, though, so don't assume. There are multiple things I've gained from them that have made a good impact in my life, at times reshaped to fit me better. The reasons I've named them are mostly because they're among the few I can still put a finger on and name, I've read thousands of articles, some of which came from here (and I'm willing to consider various ideologies, including this - I just haven't delved deeply into it yet).

I'm not interested in being a slave and know I'm not one - I choose my own path and whatever advice fits with the direction I'm going at the time may be considered suitable so I can try it out and see how it works. The reason I've abandoned the idea of working a job for an employer entirely is exactly that - not wanting to be enslaved to the normal ways of people. I'll most certainly come across TRP advice too that can be applied to my journey, I just want to take all the pieces and find a way to make them work for me depending on the situation and circumstances. So now, too, TRP ideology will be explored next.

As of now, I've seen things questioning morality, something that I have also debated in my head over the years, and I've seen some experienced people give some of the exact examples I've had in my head (relating it to the animal kingdom and how it only exists in the minds of us humans), so I like to think I'm definitely not that unfamiliar with TRP ways, I'm just going to delve into it deeper now.

Because we enjoy learning from people's real experiences too. This whole thing only works if there's enough people actually going out and learning from the real world. Otherwise the entire community generates TRP ideas from their own imagination and their own hamster, and then as a result, all the stories and ideas traded around are pointless. 

I don't really care what people do. But if you're going to want to be a contributor on TRP and if you're going to claim to be some level of knowledgable or alpha or successful, my belief is that you need to actually have results in your life to back that up. 

I am not upset or aggressive, you're reading into it what you want to see. You ask why not hand out information and let people decide? That's fine, that is what most of us do. The problem is when the people handing out the information don't know wtf they are talking about, and they are just disseminating information that is almost right because they've memorized what to say. This leads to wrong ideas - or at least ideas not reflected by the reality of sexual strategy - entering TRP's current consensus. 

Does that make sense? We don't care what people do with TRP. But we do care if they are blatantly out of touch with reality / haven't learned anything themselves, and they come on here spouting off BS.

First off, thank you guys. This is not only a great community for the men's benefit, but even more so for the women's benefit.

Around two years ago, i finished reading all the side bar and handbook 2nd ed. It was a great eye opener and everything made sense immediately. I must say that i wasn't a beta, but i didn't have much experience with women.

I started implementing everything i learned from the handbook in real life. I immediately had results, i had multiple dates, i was much more comfortable around women. I think people are afraid of the things they don't understand. But i knew women now and i knew the things they want, the things even they don't know they want.

After some dates, kisses and a few one night stands, i found a promising girl for a relationship. I must say after you read the handbook you get the feeling that women are evil. But it's a misconception. Women are evolved that way and you must understand them that way, then you get over that feeling.

In the beginning, there were some problems, especially because she was a kind of alpha in her circle. But i was very strict about the rules of TRP. Soon she accepted my authority. I made it clear that i was the dominant one and i would find another girl very easily if i wanted. 

I now realize the most important thing i did right, was being emotionally unresponsive. Women are already very emotional and you have to be -at least look like- emotionally stable. 
Whenever she cried about something stupid, or had some problem about her family, i was rock solid, i didn't cry with her, i told her that those were not that important problems, she shouldn't worry too much at max.

Whenever she had some stupid problem with me that i am not aware of, and she didn't talk with me, i just ignored her. Soon she realized -now she confesses- that we were to start talking again anyway and it was stupid for her to do this for two days. She started to talk with me directly anytime she had a problem with me.

Also very important, you should never, ever step back while she starts crying. It doesn't change anything. It's not only trp, it's my character, when she pulls a face and didn't talk with me, i asked myself these questions.

- did i get caught fucking other women? no.
- do we have a place for living? yes.
- do we have enough food and water for living? yes.
- do we have jobs and enough money? yes.

then she has some stupid problem and she will get over it. and sure she did. i never asked her, please my love tell me what's your problem. please ...

Now she says she cannot live one day without me, she tells all the time how much she loves me, how much she's lucky to have me etc. I can give her any order and she will happily do it. She prepares dinner, i have sex whenever i want, she serves well when i have a guest, she never bitches about anything.

Btw, i don't tell the same things, like you are my life bla bla. Mostly i just smile or kiss her when she says it. She knows i am not emotional and she doesn't expect the same words from me.

Again thank you TRP for everything..

UPDATE:
When i started this thread, i thought it would be deleted (there is a warning) but i wrote it anyway because i sincerely wanted to thank TRP. I didn't expect such good comments, thanks for that.

There are people who are more fanatic than the founders of TRP and take everything literally. I believe you should embrace TRP not decide everything in your life according to a book like bigots.

But the problem with TRP is that if you try to recommend it to someone, it will likely backfire and they'll hate you for it.

All we can do is hope he follows the cycle of finding TRP:

- gets mad
- starts searching on Reddit for similar stories of men being cheated on
- reads through comments on various threads in r DeadBedrooms, r relationships, r sex etc.
- invevitably sees some comments talking about how evil TRP is
- decides to come here just to see the "misogyny" and "woman hating" for himself
- sees a couple of comments that seem outrageous but make sense at the same time
- experiences cognitive dissonance
- keeps reading TRP to find out more about what they mean
- starts noticing more comments here and there that make sense
- reads the sidebar
- some truthes start sinking in
- starts posting here

**A little Note**:*About 3 years ago* i Found TRP and cant even remember how i stumbled upon here but well is the best thing that could happen to a young men however it could also be the WORST THING FOR A WEAK MINDED INDIVIDUAL.like someone here once said &gt;"you don't find TRP,It finds you". With that been said once i discover this sub i been applying what i read and continue to improve myself here and there even tho to be honest i still get a bit angry at Female Nature but Im getting to a point where  from the bottom of my heart im Accepting it for what it is ,God made women and he decided what nature to give them,God made snakes and also decided what nature to give them.I'm Finally making peace with this Reality.

**NOW THE REAL STORY**:*INTRODUCING TRP TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS*:

during the time i found TRP i went to a bar in a small town with one of my best friends whom i had not seen for a long time.we had awesome conversations,talked about life,remembered the good old times ,girls we fucked etc.once we got into deeper stuff about life and how things get harder once you reach adulthood we got into the topic of how hard dating becomes,and i had no hesitation to talk about redpill experiences with him and drop some knowledge,i also asked him if he heard about TRP and  he had no idea about it so i told him what it was 
and how its the only HARSH TRUTH about Female Nature.once i told him about it i saw how his physical well being changed as if he seen a ghost,he started  to tell me experiences with women and how "things make sense now" he said *all the women i have dated were all the same not one was different than the other* and i told him about AW-ALT and that he is not alone, neither i had dated a different women even if they acted sweet at first their true nature will be revealed inevitably.

**THE MISTAKE I MADE**:

Something I Forgot About Was That This Guy Suffered From Depression In The Past to the point of cutting himself!. Unfortunately he was WEAK MINDED!About 1.5 years later i received a text from a mutual friend of us giving me the devastating news that he had committed suicide!!that really HURT ME  This guy was just a great person and one of the best friends i ever had.i felt like TRP discovery got him into depression  

**LESSONS LEARNED**:

*Be careful who you show TRP to

*This is an individual JOURNEY

*Only advice others But dont Show them TRP if Necessary



**TO SUMMARIZE** :*I introduced TRP to one of my best friends and  he is Now DEAD*

&gt; If you're explaining to Billy the concepts of sexual strategy, text game, and frame, but he knows you haven't been laid in 6 months, then he's going to nod his head politely and write off any advice you give.

..it really depends WHO this person is and how well you know them, and how much you care about them and their future.

Case in point - it took me about 3/4 months to convince my brother that his BP bullshit was drying up all his opportunities. I gave him The Rational Male when I left the country and he actually read it! Told me he wished he'd read it years ago and how eye-opening it was, and he'd not read a book in years. I'll likely check on him from time to time in case of regression, but I think he's now on the right track.

I would also persist like this with very very close friends if I thought they were receptive to change. My brother was quite stubborn, but he'd not been laid in a long time and I was clearly having a lot of fun plating women. I think that probably helped to convince him of the legitimacy of my advice and TRP mindset.

If you don't really care about this person or their mentality or their future.. sure.. don't persist in helping them in face of their stubbornness. But if you DO care about this person, then at least put up a good fight against their doomed BP ways before you throw in the towel.

I've also had lots of casual conversations about TRP with plenty of people who have been receptive (read: know the person you're talking to) by steering the conversation if they started talking about women. I didn't necessarily have those conversations to impart advice.. I just explored some of the concepts, and suggested some reading material or whatever if they seemed interested. A couple of guys got back to me (one a co-worker at the time) who had gone off and spent the night reading Rational Male blog. I understand some people are unwilling to change and not interested in anything that might affect the security of their beliefs, but there is a serious problem if you're surrounded by people like that.

I'm starting to think people suggest you don't talk about TRP because they don't want any competition haha my experience of speaking about TRP with mature, intelligent men (whether BP or not) is nothing like what is described here.

Yes it is men fault, but let's not discount the physiological abuse we do to men.  I was taught my body was worthless compared to a women.

This is why you see young men saying "Oh I wish my teacher had of raped me"

Even though men who were raped by their female teacher have immense trauma , they still think they want it

You see more women saying it's wrong and more men saying it's ok, until we stop demonizing men this will continue

Over the years, men have been subject to relentless propaganda that women are the oppressed class. We have been taught to buy into the "gender pay gap" myth, to believe that "toxic masculinity" is a scourge on society, and that men are responsible for all domestic violence and sex crimes.  Politicians, mainstream media, courts, and the "permanent bureaucracy" composed of a few elites with self-serving interests have permitted legislation and policies to "level the playing field" for women.   But the playing field is anything but level.

The result? *Equal rights for women does not translate into equal treatment for men.* Men are now officially second class citizens in most of the developed world and no longer enjoy the same privileges and immunities as women.  Facts show that men are actually far worse off in developed nations than women:

*Men are 14x more likely to be incarcerated and spend time in prison than women.  The criminal justice system is designed to prosecute and incarcerate men even though women are equally (or more) guilty of crimes such as child abuse, child neglect, domestic violence, prostitution, etc.

*Men are 5-10x more likely to commit suicide in developed nations.  Because most of the mental health, counseling and social services are funded for women, men are suffering in silence and are taking their lives at astounding rates;

*Men are much more likely to die earlier in life than women because they hold the majority of dangerous jobs (construction, military, mining etc.) and suffer more stress related diseases such as heart attacks and  strokes.

*Women have dominated college enrollment and graduation rates since the 1980's due to affirmative action policies that lower standards for women and punish young men attempting to get degrees in science, technology, engineering and math.  The rise of "women studies" and "gender studies" programs have also had a discriminatory effect on admissions and degrees, as these programs are exclusively catered towards women.  Young men are also the overwhelming target of sexual assault witch hunts on college campuses.

*Men ages 18-26 must still register for mandatory selective military service in the U.S., but not women.  Because of equal rights lawsuits, women are now voluntarily allowed to occupy any position in the military; but when it comes to mandatory selective service draft, only men are forced to enroll and die for their country.
It is estimated that only 3% of alimony recipients are men. Although middle and upper-class women are equally represented in the work force, they are extracting a whopping 97% of the total alimony and child support payments.  Most men who go through a divorce will lose just about everything.

*Men are more likely to be targeted in employment discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape and domestic violence claims and will suffer the disproportionate loss of jobs, income, life, liberty and property as a result of these types of claims.  Although the media tends to focus on high-profile men, millions of other men, whose stories are untold, are suffering worse fates because they lose the only source of their basic livelihood to these types of allegations.

*70% or more of the homeless population is male.    Because of skewed social programs and benefits for women, untreated physical and mental health problems for men, veterans and those that lost their homes and lives to incarceration or divorce, the majority of the homeless suffering is male.

So what do men do about this dismal state of affairs?  Most men who are not blogging in the manosphere, including our politicians are too afraid to say anything about the second citizen class status of males. Too many men are afraid of a #metoo backlash to speak up. However, our collective silence, complaining, and inaction will continue to allow feminist groups to dominate the discussion and set policies and agendas that drive men further into decay.

Here are some concrete steps we can take in our everyday lives to call out the injustice against men and attempt to level the playing field: 

*Do not allow woman to use their sexual powers to dominate you.  Men have allowed their rights to be stripped from them because they are beholden to sex from women.  Free yourself of sexual coercion and you will be able to think more clearly about your rights and freedom.

*Report any instances of sexual harassment, sexual battery, domestic violence, child neglect, child abuse, etc. caused by women (however minor or egregious) to the authorities and demand prosecution and accountability.  Men are far too reluctant to voice these complaints for fear of having their masculinity questioned.  Women, however, readily take advantage of the system and men's failure to report women has fueled the myth that only men are the abusers or violate these laws.  If you do not report women, you are fueling the problem.

*Avoid closed door meetings and one-on-one sessions with women at work. This will only open you up to opportunities for false allegations.

*Avoid hiring and promoting feminists if you can do so legally. Women, especially radicalized feminists are dominating the workforce and taking control of companies, political positions, etc. due to policies that wildly favor them.  In the current climate, women have better and more opportunities than men with the same education and they are taking full advantage of it to the detriment of men.  Men need to start looking out for each other and help men.

*Do not fight or argue with women.  You will only be opening yourself up to some sort of "abuse" allegations if the relationship goes south.  Instead, document your woman partner's irrational behavior and any instances of abuse towards you.  Develop a file with text messages, pictures, emails, etc. that you can use later against the woman if it appears she is ready to turn on you.

*Pay attention to the politicians and judges you are electing.  Find out whether these people are supporting irrational women's rights and their voting records.  Get the word out to your friends, family and community to elect politicians and judges who are reasonable and support equal rights, not feminist agendas.

*Get the word out to your friends, family and colleagues that men are suffering as second class citizens.  Share these posts with your network and social media contacts, especially with people who are "neutral".  Feminists have done a great job of converting these people to their side because men have not provided counterpoints and arguments over the years.   It's important that we speak up and speak out without fearing reprisal and feeling guilty for supporting men's basic humanitarian rights.

In conclusion, men have become disposable second class citizens and have allowed themselves to accept this fate.  The biased media reporting and political airways are filled with propaganda that paints women as the oppressed class, when the reality is quite the opposite.  However, most men have become far to docile and accepting of the current state of affairs and our inaction is only making things worse for us.  Please help level the playing field by helping men.

Hi, I'll keep this short and simple.


Since the dawn of humanity men were always in control, held all the power and women were happy because of it. But now men are forced to lose their masculinity and power or else they'll be killed/punished by other pussy men with big guns and laws who believe feminism is the right path for humanity.


Women value masculinity in a man just like men value femininity in a woman. Once you take away those values, there's nothing left to value. Why treat something with appreciation and respect if you don't value it? You don't. Thus women will continue ruining men's lives with false rape claims and draining them financially. All while bitching they're being oppressed because they've lost all masculine value and influence they used to have and are supposed to have from men.


Feminism is really a blessing in disguise because it's a wake up call for men and a hidden cry for help from women for men to regain their masculinity, integrity and control over women.﻿


Although the damage caused by feminism is nearly irreversible at this point, we have options, although, not easy ones. We could do a complete reform of our system concerning the values we hold in society towards women which will result in major physical conflict between the corrupted feminized men and the masculinized men who still respect the traditional relationship dynamics that causes males and females to click and work with each other properly. Or we wait until feminism evolves to the point where women start storing sperm in large containers and plan to kill or ship off all the men on the planet which will FINALLY cause men to wake up and realize this is going to be a problem for the future of humanity. Don't worry, men will deal with this problem rather quickly because they're only women. Either way, something has to change.

Sissy men will try to earn leadership because they are sissies and never leaders. Real man will go and ask the woman to do what he wants. That is it. Don't be sissy be a real man.

&gt; Men get murdered more, men die younger, etc

Usually at the hands of other men.

What the vast majority of women fail to grasp is that all of this, society and their position, was put into place by men.  Men enforce the state of affairs.  At some point, there won't be enough men under their tents to enforce their prerogatives...  and that's when things get interesting.

Enjoy the decline.

&gt; competition, giving, and protecting

Da fuq? You're defining what is it to be a 'good man', as Jack Donovan puts it. There is a difference between a 'good man' and a man 'good at being a man'. Do you feel the difference? 

The guy who is a 'good man' is cucked, and values feminine traits. The man who is 'good at being a man' is amoral and is precisely what the OP suggests.

&gt;misogyny, slut shaming

Fuck off with your white knight, cucked bullshit.

Women aren't  raised like men, they have no sense of honour. Npo sense of higher life or death virtue that we as men have drilled into us from when we were toddlers.


Men are taught we should lay down our lives for our loved ones or our belief in what is right. We have films and media idolising that and always showing the hero sacrificing for his greater good or his family or a woman (I think dying for a woman is bluepilled now).


Women aren't taught any of that from the ground up like small stuff "respect a mans handshake", **"don't kick a man while he's down"** none of this stuff they write off as "toxic masculinity" and scoff at is absorbed by them. It actually makes them severely lacking in character. 

There's so much as lads we are taught. What are they taught? Find a man to die for you, you can convince a man to fight your battles for you. Don't worry you don't have to take responsibility for anything. 
Women don't have any honour like we do.


That's why you are right. You cannot make a deal with a woman like you can with a man.. 

I mean one of the Matt Lauer accusers just came out and said "It was totally consensual" but still said she was "traumatised".

Women are so emotional and hysterical and just having a current trend can make a woman destroy your life or join in a flock of women harming men or a specific man because of "feels".

It's actually incredible. And I bolded **"don't kick a man while he is down"** and this should instantly click with any man reading this. Think of the absolute psychopathic levels of pain a woman will inflict on a man without thinking twice and even convincing herself that the man is at fault and was "always abusive" and "I never loved you" and think of the common sense of honour most men have and the feeling of "not kicking a man while he's down" women just don't operate like that.

It explains so much.

13092
&gt; All this is easy to understand if you realise that men are active and women are passive/reactive. (Yin and yang, really.) Men are givers, women are takers. (This is not "good" or "bad", it's just a fact based in evolution and biology.)

Women give too. 

&gt; Men build civilizations, and I mean literally. It's men who go out there and build roads and houses. It's men who actually do the real work. 

Women have done those things and more and most men do not/have not built civilizations. 

&gt; Feminists love that women now outnumber men in the US workforce

Shouldn't you love that too? Don't you want women to do *real* work like men?

&gt; but 90% of women's jobs are either beurocratic or some kind of customer service, so in reality women in these jobs do not CREATE anything, they just leech off of the jobs that produce wealth. 

OK? Most men don't create jobs either and leech off of other men. Think of minority men in different countries that leech off of "whitey's"? Welfare, affirmative action, section 8 housing, etc, are used by men too. 

&gt; So, what I'm getting at is men need motivation to channel their energies into building things. And there exists only one thing in the whole wide world which can motivate enough men to work together: having their own families. 

So no families means men don't work? Interesting. I've heard that when men divorce their wives, they stop seeing their children because men want to be family men. I think that's stupid but whatev's. 

&gt; No amount of shaming or monetary rewards can motivate enough men to voluntarily slave their lives away in soul-crushing jobs.

Is that why there are more homeless men than women?

&gt; We are at a stage where the government is actually forcing men to work (child support, alimony, etc), but all those with eyes open know that this is SLAVERY and will not work in the long term.

Not slavery. You're getting paid. And taking responsibility for the children you father. 

&gt; Feminism strips men of their families, thus strips them of their motivation to build civilization.

Again, you accuse women of not taking responsibility while not taking responsibility yourself. 

&gt; And rest assured, if men begin to "slack" in vast numbers, women will NOT grab the shovel and do the dirty work. This is why matriarchal civilizations collapse. If men are not interested in it, they will disengage and let it rot away. 

Women work. Women are garbage collectors, technicians, engineers, lawyers, police officers, architects and are in other valuable positions. 

The problem is that those areas are predominantly male and women are constantly harassed by them. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/20/3-psychologists-explain-why-men-harass-women-in-the-workplace.html

"Shawn Burn, Ph.D., is a psychology professor at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis. She says "sometimes, sexual harassment is used to intimidate, disempower, and discourage women in traditionally male-dominated occupations."

&gt; Men were always told to man up and not act like a little bitch. Only recently men started to act like women, and no wonder suicides went up.

Actually, that is a very good point.

1451
When were all those men born? Not in the early 90's or 2000's that's for sure. It's a whole different world between the men of then and the men of now. The men of then were just starting to be subjected to an increase of feminism. The men now are receiving it full force.

The problem is your looking for exclusivity with girls &amp; thus get caught in scarcity. 

You should be lining your contacts list with girls that you can fuck. Go on tinder, hit up girls you know, get numbers. You should have your phone filled with fuckable girls. 

7371
Sure thing man.

18 almost 19, UK(North West), No beard, black. Moderately attractive, just as fair as everybody else here. 

The thing is though, I'm incredibly nerdy. I'm saying this so people don't get the impression that I'm one of those big muscular black guys who get girls easily. I hit the gym but I'm fairly slim. Not huge arms or anything, just near moderate. Used to wear glasses but swapped them out for contacts. Don't have a hairstyle, just plain.

Now for the approach, I'd like to add that I'm not counting saying quick remarks to girls. Only full approaches.
Stats:
Approached Successfully - 15 girls. 
Rejected - 4
Approached me - 5

Anybody can get rejected so it doesn't mean a single thing. For instance, I spoke to a lot of girls studying mundane shit that I didn't care about yet they were all attractive and into me. I meet these two girls, bantering back and forth, I become interested in one and she tells me that she's studying something in literature. Now I'm attracted to women who are actually smart and not just basic. The conversation seems to be going super well but then the girl says that she needs to go to the toilet. They go off, I assume they left the club but later I see them standing. I come and talk to the girl again for a bit, ask her if she has snapchat. She starts to look around trying to find an answer. At this point I realise what's happening when she said she doesn't have it. I smirk and tell her that she's lying but in a playful way and go elsewhere. 

I honestly can't explain my mindset that night. Usually rejection would be an issue but I was treating it like I was playing a video game. This game doesn't work? Move on to the next. 
The hilarious thing was that that same girl was one of the most unattractive girls physically I met that night yet she rejected me. Hell come to think of it, I was only rejected by girls who were roughly 6s or less. At the start of the night when we started approaching, I tried talking to two girls and they simply waved me away.

Rejection just means nothing man.

Now for the friends thing, as much as I hate to say it, they didn't approach at all. There was just something up with their moods that night, even they explained it. These guys are casual approachers and do it often but that night they were acting a little beta. I did all the approaches and sometimes they would try to join my set.

When I approached the eight girls, as soon as I was hooking them in the conversation, one of my friends comes and sits down. The girls completely ignore him so he leaves. 

Inside the club, that same friend wants me to come and approach with him. I specifically said as a joke but half serious. "Can you keep up with my energy?"
The reason I said this is because you both need to be on the same level of emotional state. He was feeling a little down and not so talkative whereas I was jumping into every situation. 

We agree to go together so I tell him to find a girl. He points at a purple haired girl in the distance who he thinks is absolutely gorgeous. I simply smile and then go up to her with him.
(As I write this I'm starting to realise how good that really was. I didn't even think about it, just walked up straight to her.)
The girl is with another girl and one guy. I notice that the guy had long white hair and a white coat, basically dressed like a rockstar so that is my point of interaction. 
I go to the girls with my friend and immediately open the guy by telling him he has an awesome jacket. Whilst that happens, my friend comes in and tries to talk to one of the girls. I can't remember what happened because it was all so quick but the purple haired girl starts bantering with me and I explain to her that my friend thinks she's attractive. We both start laughing together. At this point, the rockstar guy had walked off.
Both girls fall hooked into a conversation with me whilst my friend tries to join back in but can't.

He then accused me of AMOGing afterwards. 

Point is, I did all my approaches alone.  Actually, I remember telling the french girls that I was in the club by myself. They absolutely loved me for it. I'd never go to a club by myself though, it's different. 

Hope this helps mate!

I think he might be right. 

Fatherless girls will probably be better for a sexual relationships since they seek a "daddy" and an alpha Chad will provide that. These girls probably won't be loyal long term though compared to girls with fathers.

Basically, fatherless girls make better sluts. Girls with fathers make better girlfriends.

In my experience, there are girls who have substance and are flexible, and there are those who don't. Some girls can be charmed by your personality. Others can only be charmed by your looks and social value. Both can be charmed by looks and social value, but only one of them can be turned in the other direction. This is a fact, in my book.  It's up to you to decide which ones you want and do whatever you need to do to get there. The reality is that 90% of the girls who are all about social value and looks aren't very interesting people. I need someone i can talk to about shit that i like. People with substance, from whom i can even learn something. That doesn't happen with those types of girls. They have nothing to say. On the other hand, you do find girls that will look at something unusual and feel intrigued by it. Girls who love to talk. Girls who are deep. Girls who are smart. Girls that aren't looking to be IG superstars Those exist. Their profiles tell me everything i need to know about whether or not they're worth the effort. 

I don't quite understand this obsession with the social value thing. I mean...yeah, that helps a lot, but it isn't a prerequisite to get girls. I'm not a very social person and the girls i nail know that. They still wanna talk to me and be with me. The most important thing is simply them enjoying what they receive for you. Whether is your attention, the things you say, the way you make them feel when they're next to you. There are many, many, many factors that people around here often ignore, and i suspect that's why you miss so many great opportunities. You're looking only in one direction, assuming there's only one way and girls are all the same and want the same exact thing. That's factually false. 



12636
that's right and after 25 they even lose something.. something is not there anymore like a glow..

they go from girl to woman but woman is not so attractive for us anymore as girl was...

2463
its not what the koran says. i was raised orthodox sunni hanafi. its what people do with the religion. 

girls dont not have sex just because koran.
girls dont just obey their husband just because koran
girls dont just tolerate second wives just because koran

it all depends on the girl

13904
to have a girl is ALWAYS hard work..


1) you work hard on yourself and get a girl


2) you work hard for a girl and get a girl


both ways require energy, but 1st way is way better than the second way

10278
Nope. Pretty much all are 6/10 or above these days. The last 5.5 girl I fucked was part of a threesome with a hotter girl, and I wasn't going to turn that down. 

4845
All of my spontaneous threesomes have started with me being out with a girl I've hooked up with or am about to, and meeting up with an acquaintance or girl that's shown some signals, NOT a romantic interest. It needs to be a girl in town for the weekend, a friend of a friend, etc. 

Get the two girls talking by way of a gentlemanly introduction, and play up the first girl's hotness. "This is my friend Ashley, she's a former model" or whatever.

Then take first girl home and text second girl saying you're going back for a night cap and to swing by. Nothing else. 

Second girl shows up. She'll immediately talk to first girl because women are social pros. Let it go from there. If you need to encourage a bit, tell both girls they're hot and ask if they've ever dated other girls. Don't start making out with one and isolate the other. 

12074
I've called a girl a dork before (I like when girls are dorky) and she fucking blew up. 

Honestly, it depends on the girl. If a girl has a brother(s) you can say almost anything.

You people are crazy.

Do whatever the fuck you want. One of the lesser touched upon results of TRP implementation is having the freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because you da man.

You ain't da man if you gotta ask random dudes on the internet if you should fuck girls or hang out with them. 

Do whatever the fuck you want.

You are thirsty, not getting laid and thinking you own the bitch if you ever do get laid is why it turns you off. You know the bitch is going to cheat on you, but you think you'll find that unicorn that won't. Dude, she isn't yours, it's only your turn.

I've fucked enough wives and girlfriends to know that any bitch will cheat given opportunity and plausible deniability. These bitches like me because they know I'm not going to keep them, it's nothing more than fucking.

I know guys who like to watch their wife get fucked, it's their thing man. Not mine. I haven't cared in years if a girl I'm fucking is fucking other dudes, I get mine and she's not the only one I'm fucking. Like I said, I don't own her, she doesn't belong to me, bitches can leave any time they want, and if a sorry sap like you married one to try and keep her, she gets half your sit at least as a reward for your stupidity.

 This is reality, this is how people are, and while you wait for her to fuck you, she is out fucking someone like me then coming home and not giving you any.

1563
Dude.  You are fucking youself.

Never. EVER fucking sign marriage papers.

And what the fuck are you doing raising another mans kids and fucking a whore of a mother?

And finally... keep your feelz to yourself with your new gf.  Don't be a fucking pussy. Jesus christ man.

11525
If you’ve fucked sluts, and you’ve fucked women; you can definitely tell the difference in them. If you’re THAT interested- use your fucking brain and make a decision. 

7290
&gt; So often deadbedrooms aren't because sex isn't occurring at all, it's because it has been transferred to a different bedroom and you're being cucked!

Women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. If she's not giving it to you, she's eagerly giving it to someone else who doesn't give nearly as much of a shit about her as you do.

7728
in no way did i say dont fuck a 10 :)

just there is no reason not to fuck something new most nights, even when in a "relationship"

15106
Fuck her , leave right after you fuck her, never text her back. Your chapter between you and her will be over. Dont worry about her feelings, she doesnt care about yours since she told you she is fucking someone else

9223
What has worked for me is "I would have to give a fuck about you to give a fuck about your opinions - I don't. Flush yourself, turd." and walk away...

7725
What if they leave for a break and get fucked and tell you, and you get back together. Even if you were fucking other girls as well

17607
I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER fucking work under &amp; for a woman.

To be honest I don't mind post wall women as long as they are my age. I'm 30 myself so a 30 year old woman is fine by me. However, I refuse any woman who is older than me.

12636
that's right and after 25 they even lose something.. something is not there anymore like a glow..

they go from girl to woman but woman is not so attractive for us anymore as girl was...

I'd agree with you if this actually was exploring the nature of women but it really isn't. The best way to do that is to go out and meet women and get to know them. Also all I've seen so far is assuming and bitching about women, not getting to know them. Also, spoiler alert, women aren't that mysterious! Just other people!

15737
Perhaps. Or perhaps I just come from the manosphere 10 years ago when WIMP is defined "Women-Influenced Male Person".

Look at both TRP or MRP. How many men are improving themselves so they can be attractive to women? How many men are doing X or Y so they can be attractive to women? How many male people here are influenced by women?

Spend your time however you like, but make sure you're doing it for yourself, not for women or being "manly" to women. That's all I was saying 

9844
you're a woman then. you have a bunch of beta male orbiters.

Attractive women will not like you because of your friends.

edit: also because women like men

7493
I was saying to this woman I know that few women in the US wear perfume or makeup or or go out of their way to be attractive. She was like "we don't need to." She's right, and I think we'll know that the dynamic is changing when more women try to be attractive. I didn't make a play for this woman. Just told her about the smokeshow European women I date. The ones that wear perfume.

8781
Why are they leaving out "with a woman"? We all know this shit doesn't apply to women not getting consent. It's to be used by women against men. 

5742
&gt;Women care about women, men care about women.

What? The only ones that despise women more than anything are other women. Women generally do things that benefits them , not for the sake of benefiting all women, people are selfish overall.

Also how easily women break of BFF statuses, talk shit behind their "besties" back, spill the secrets. 

17607
I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER fucking work under &amp; for a woman. EVER..........

9337
you forget this is about replacing men.

the law states you must have 50% women in a company, women hire women, women mentor women, women lunch women.

Ask yourself. Who lift's and who doesn't.

Take it from someone who played football in high school and stopped lifting afterwards. You will get fat. Yea you may never be obese but at the very least you'll be skinny fat. Lift and develop lean muscle. You don't need to be huge. That only comes from bulking. You control how your body will look like not weights. You don't like your environment? Change it. Always be on point or you risk your woman will run of to superman.

FWIW, I think going into fitness by cutting to 10% first has a lot of benefits that will continue to show down the road.

- Cutting forces you to actually pay attention to what you eat rather than just eating a shitton under the excuse that you're 'bulking'. If you start by successfully getting lean, you will have reached a point where fitness is part of your lifestyle and you have the discipline to stick to it.

- Cutting to low body fat makes your face and body look better. Gaining muscle mass when you're not lean doesn't make you look much better until you cut later on.

- Low body fat makes it easier to gain mass, and it makes your gains more apparent, which is important for motivation.

- After a cut you are ready to slow bulk. Your body shape won't change drastically, you will always be pretty low bf% with an added pound every month or two. This is useful if you like having clothes that fit.

 Agreed.  Having one cheat meal here and there isn't going to make you a fat slob anymore than going to the gym once in a while is going to get you jacked.  Both are a kind of building imo. It takes days upon days, weeks upon weeks,  months upon months, years upon years to keep building muscle.  Your diet is the same thing.  You don't become fat or obese because you grab something fat and greasy from a fast food joint once in a blue moon.  It comes from the days, weeks, etc of the food you eat and the excess calories day after day.  No one wants to eat chicken, rice, and broccoli 7 days a week for their entire life.  Even competion bodybuilders go on a little bender here and there on the off season.  But you have to know how to get down to dick skin body fat when the time comes.  If you've never gotten there and don't know how to manipulate your diet (many also have the help of drugs also) to get the results you want then you have to learn that before you hit that supersize big Mac.  But just like lifting your diet needs to be consistent as well. You're going to miss days at the gym and you're going to go on a bender once and a while with your diet.  No biggie as long as it's not an extended bender.

They don't do it because it's slow and hard. Possibly even harder than putting on mass, because restraining from eating when your body tells you it wants surplus calories instead of a deficit, is arguably even harder than lifting weights.

I would rate the difficulty pyramid as follows.

-Not doing anything (doesn't lift, doesn't lose body fat, just a couch potato)

-Lifting weights with correct macros and calorie surplus (needs discipline)

-Has lifted *and* cut down to sub-10% body fat (needs massive levels of discipline, most people will never have the willpower)

13595
I have to agree. The primary reason I am in the gym is for myself, to be bigger and stronger than the next guy.  I'll say this, the 4 years I lifted in college, going from roughly 170 to 190 (10% or less bf) boasted my confidence through the roof and get this, even when I stopped lifting in graduate school and later when working..i still felt the same about my body, even though I am sure my strength dropped and I gained weight.  Guess what?  IT was mostly in my own head where I needed the most gains. 

I also agree it is best to cut down once you reach your weight goal.  You can't be worrying about calories when you are trying to bulk, you just need to eat as much as you gain to put on the weight.  Unless your really overweight and need to lose 20lbs, cutting 5lbs should not be that problematic.

For example, my personal goal is 200, I've never hit 200 
lean.  So I am lifting to hit 200 and then I'll cut back 192-195 where ever 10-11% would place me.

*Read the edits before commenting / PMing me*

You will NEVER be able to outlift a bad diet. This is a simple reality that everyone who seeks a greater physique should know and understand. I know for a fact you guys know this but you need to APPLY it. Don't just tell yourself that you're going to eat healthy and then drink a beer with a pizza the same evening.

Quit making excuses like 'I deserve to eat that one cheat meal, I worked out 4 times this week!'. This is the kind of mentality that will set you so far back in the long run.

When you first start lifting you will make gains no matter what you eat. If you take it seriously. You will lift heavier weights and your muscles will get bigger. This will go on for a few months, perhaps up to 1-2 years.

You will get used to eating bad and working out, but that is NOT the way you should be doing it. The fact that it works when you start out is maybe the reason why a lot of guys hit a plateau after a certain time. Once you hit that plateau it's hard. Your muscles are big but theres a lot of fat covering it, no definition and it's not as good as it could be. 

If you just started lifting, do not fall into that trap. Start improving your diet right away. Start counting your calories and cut everything unhealthy from your life.

Don't drink soda, drink water.
Don't eat dessert, eat a fruit.
Don't eat fries, eat rice.
Eat home-cooked meals.
Get these vegetables in.

I lifted for a long time without eating right, I built strenght, but I was not lean. I successfully dropped 40 pounds in 8 months by just changing my eating habits. The workouts remained the same, but everything else changed. I feel a lot better than I used to and I wish I had started eating right from the get-go.

If you need help with your diet, feel free to PM me.

EDIT: You cannot go cold turkey and completely change your diet overnight, but you should be trying to improve overtime and set goals. Do not fall into a comfort zone. Cheat meals are obviously a thing, but do not have 3 of them a week. Keep it to a minimum if you're struggling.

Edit 2 : This post is obviously not gonna apply to everybody, we're all different. Some guys can eat whatever they want and stay small, while some have a hard time cutting. That's life. 

Edit 3 : I am NOT a nutritionist nor am I a professional bodybuilder. I successfully achieved a decent cut and I just wanted to share the mentality I had with you guys. This post was for new guys who just got into lifting. I believed they should be aware that a dirty bulk is not the way to go and that if they decided to get into lifting, they should also get into a better diet.

I agree with the last statement. I'm about there except I have less fat more height. My best physique was 188 6 percent or so. But keeping your body fat low only facilitates long term muscle growth, when you're gaining weight.

I'll set you in on a secret that nobody will believe, but I'll mention anyways. You can cardio bulk. It has to be something like cross country running, rowing or swimming that uses a lot of muscle fibers, but since cardio has less of an after burn than lifting, you can gain more mass by reversing the deficit faster. What's more now you're building an endurance base so that when you cut, by lifting weights in the gym, you will recover better and have more energy for intense sets. This is healthier for your body than traditional bodybuilding, but nearly nobody does it because they want to see instant results. Not subtle slow twitch growth under a layer of fat while they're bulking,mand then they won't believe it's possible to train power while cutting. It is is if you have enough body fat and aerobic fitness to use it as fuel for more intense workouts. You don't intentionally cut weight it comes off because you're aerobically strong enough to burn more calories in a workout than naysayers would ever predict.

I hated being fat (for me that was 205 at 6’2) and I cut down too aggressively without maintaining much muscle to 175. I was too skinny. I think it was still good because it helped put on a lot of lean mass without much fat. This is because cutting made me get good at counting macros and calories and made me fight hard not to gain too much fat. I put on 25 lbs and started cutting again, this time I’m much bigger and my cut won’t be very long.

If you’re above 15% I’d recommend cutting down to 10-12 and immediately start bulking (give yourself a week or two at maintenance, then lean bulk 300-500 cal surplus). Do it until your chest starts getting saggy or your abs are invisible in the best of lighting.

It depends on your body type of course, but I’d rather have low body fat and less muscle than high body fat. High muscle low body fat is of course the best option.

Super low body fat is not a good look on anyone. Keep it above 8%, and maybe 10% is ideal.

Growing up, I was a fat kid that got no attention from the ladies.  Eventually I manned up and took responsibility and lost the weight.  Life got way better, way more confidence, more attention, etc.  However, I went from fat to skinny fat as a result of just dieting with no exercise.  I was petrified of becoming fat again after experiencing how much better being normal was.  Later on, people started mentioning off-hand that I was skinny.  Sometimes I would get light headed and easily tired.  As a man in his 20's in his supposed physical prime years, I knew it would only get worse.  I looked in the mirror and saw myself as I was: out of shape, low muscle, unhealthy.  So, I manned up and took responsibility and went to the gym.  Not wanting to get fat, I counted calories and macros to do just enough to get stronger and by proxy gain muscle.  I did that for about a year, and stopped making progress after a few months.  I would get injured, drop the weight to recover, get back to previous level, and get sick/injured/miss workouts.  I was dedicated, didn't give up, pushed myself, studied proper form, etc.  Being stuck with a sub 250lb squat and other subpar lifts after a year of gym work, I knew something more than bad luck was wrong here.  I'm not a special snowflake.  So, I manned up and recently took responsibility and started eating more.

In the last few months, I've blown through PR's almost every workout.  Life is better, and now I'm reaching my goals at a resonable rate.  My point is that fat is easily lost and gained.  Unless you're in your teens and early twenties, building muscle is going to be a battle.  Don't fuck around, like I did, with "slow bulking" or "lean gains" for fear of fat.  I'll be clear here, as idiots with poor reading comprehension like to make straw men:  I'm saying don't eat like a pig and dirty bulk.  However, the vast majority of the people on this sub need to realize that once you have a decent foundation of strength and muscle, cutting is much much easier.  Past the first bit of training, you will have to make a choice between losing fat and gaining muscle.  Trying to do both at the same time is going to take orders of magnitude longer than standard bulk/cut cycles.

I have been fat, I have been skinny, and now more muscled.  At the end of the day, if you have the discipline to change your body composition and know you can do it, then being 6-8% more fat for a while to optimize muscle growth won't even bother you.

Im the kind of person that likes to eat healthy as well. I dirty gained when I first started because at 55kg your body doesn't give a fuck what you're putting in to gain weight, but, over time I made my diet more and more lean and I haven't lost any weight, I've only gotten more muscular. 

When I bulk I eat between 3000 and 4000 calories a day. I eat 1lb of chicken breast every day, one protein shake as soon as I wake up on a rest day or after a work out on work out days, then a second shake right before sleep. I eat 3 eggs and one chicken or turkey sausage every day. The rest of my diet is IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros). For the most part when bulking I ignore my Fat macro. I just make sure to hit my Carb and Protein goals. If I eat too much fat during bulk, i'll just burn it off during cut. The body can only gain something like 2lbs of muscle max a month anyway. At our size it's easier to take on weight however you can and burn the excess fat later, that part comes easy to us. 

As for workouts during bulk, I work out only 3 days a week but focus on heavy heavy lifts. Then when I cut I keep the same strength training program but do HIIT exercises 5 days a week and add some target muscle work on my two non-lift days. ex: biceps, abs, calves, traps.

I'm not very active outside of my training programs, so, for someone like you, you may need a lot more calories in your life. Chicken, protein shakes, greek yogurt, and whole grain pastas are dense protein/carbohydrate foods that are all good things to eat on a daily basis. The number one thing is consistency. Get a calorie tracking app like MyFitnessPal, set goals, break them.

Yeah dude. Entrepreneurship all the way. 

But the censored wangs thing... That's always been my theory and I'm sticking to it. 

Regarding the inferiority thing it's just like white guys that don't date white girls that date black guys. In Japan the Japanese guys will not use the services of Japanese prostitutes that bang white guys. Very similar undercurrents in both scenarios.

You can make the same argument for short guys too. Actually I think it's even more important for short guys. A tall guy with a below average build will still be perceived as more alpha than a short guy. If you work in corporate America, just look at the average height of the managers and executives.

You're going to keep seeing content like this because these guys aren't used to doing anything like it in their past. 

I agree this is nothing but a guy bragging. Sounds like the girl and the guy wasn't even dating. Let him have his fun me probably deserves some praise after years of being rejected by women. 

7425
GARBAGE but here it is because it will be deleted (following is the original post):

Know some things about me before you read my post: First of all, I’m not male so there’s only one other thing I could be. Secondly, you and all of your plates/exs would look like 3’s compared to me. Yes, you should feel bad that most ppl look terrible. About 90% of women are low value/underaverage/average (average is just a nice way of saying ugly). It’s not my fault the world values beauty over everything else. Society was set up that way before I was born.

Like the title says - Do guys get increasingly insecure the longer they go without sex? Bc girls don’t. Girls can’t even fathom what it’s like to be insecure without sex.

The question is: is it possible for guys to be secure without sex?

I’m sure if you surveyed all of the sluts/porn stars/prostitutes in the world asking them if they got insecure without sex, 99% of them would say “no”. They also wouldn’t know that guys got insecure without sex bc ppl only care about themselves.

That’s too deep of a topic for girls to entertain, guys getting insecure without sex. They also just wouldn’t care about what guys wanted.

Girls just know that guys WANT sex. And they like taking advantage of it to manipulate/enslave guys. They don’t care that guys get insecure without sex.

So, is it possible for guys to be secure without sex? Bc they should try to achieve that. Guys shouldn’t want to have anything to do with women for as long as they are manipulative. Going after women is the least productive thing guys could possibly be doing right now. It’s like feeding into a black hole.

TL; DR Guys shouldn’t trust women with their security bc they are selfish/manipulative/malicious/retarded

I’m expecting a lot of dumb comments so just know a few things about female nature before you want to dismiss my post because you feel threatened by how true it is: (1) you were manipulated to obsess over sex so that women could take advantage of you (2) girls obsess over how to manipulate guys (3) girls get their ego from manipulating guys &amp; they don’t want to give that up (4) girls don’t get physically attached. They don’t even know what that is. That’s like some alien concept to them (5) most of trp ideology is wrong bc it revolves around their rigid belief that girls are highly sexual (6) it’s hilarious, if you let guys come up with truths about women/the world, they will oversex the entire thing

^ I posted this once before and it got taken down by a mod who’s jealous of me for being smarter than him or something, I don’t know. Could you leave it up this time even if it gets 5000 downvotes? This post is more important than any other post on this subreddit. This post should be made into an announcement &amp; it should be put in the sidebar.

Here is some more information so that you don’t get confused and say something stupid in the comments like what happened the last time I posted:

Why did I identify as female in my post? Bc the other times I posted, everyone thought I was a guy and talked to me like I was a guy. I wanted to clear things up.

Don’t tell me females need male attention to feel secure. Attention and sex are different. Girls don't get insecure without sex.

All the guys browsing/posting on this subreddit get insecure without sex. TRP wouldn’t exist if all men were secure without sex.

Trp taught you the wrong things about male-female dynamics. Girls don't categorize guys into AF/BB. Seriously, who came up with that concept? That’s the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life.

Yes, girls are VERY insecure, but they don’t get insecure without sex.

This is something very important for all guys to know and internalize:The only reason girls come back for more sex is to make sure guys put their full effort into validating them and doing as they like, which is taking advantage of guys and essentially emasculating them. Girls don’t feel validated from the physical act of sex itself, they know that guys are desperate for sex so they come back for more sex thinking they can use it to get other things that they actually want out of guys. Yes, all of your ex-gfs did this to you, all of your past hookups did this to you, and all of your future hookups will be doing this to you. Society was set up this way for women to have this particular advantage over men.

I already know you guys are going to comment something really ignorant so here is a tip for you on how to be a realistic person: if guys saw women as putting money/resources/emotional support as their number one priority and saw them as not having a genuine drive to desire guys physically, then they would have a much more accurate view of women.

Don’t bring up some experience of yours to prove some girls legitimately want sex, it doesn’t change the fact that their initial reason for coming back for more sex was to get other things out of you. Girls can't keep up with how sexual guys are on a biological level (the frequency and variety they want sex) so they would only tolerate it to get other things out of guys. Guys were manipulated by society to have high sex drives specifically so women could enslave them. Guys can't build healthy relationships with women because women (and society) are the problem. Women are the darkest beings to ever walk the earth.

Don’t tell me to post in AskTRP, this subreddit gets more traffic so that’s why I posted here.

&gt; Do you want to be the guy that approaches 100 women and gets a lay out of it

How about this?  Be the guy that approaches 200 people a day and find friends, business contacts, new hobbies, artists, lost relatives, a new plumber, the guy that gives you a deal on rugs, a city council man to help you with your development proposal, all sorts of other things and occasionally pussy.

Be THAT GUY.  The guy that talks to everyone.  It will get you more sex and more everything than this nonsense.

12544
The other times I posted, everyone thought I was a guy and talked to me like I was a guy. I wanted to clear things up. Also, you should be intimidated that a girl knows better than you.

9390
&gt; The first time I even think there's interest in another guy, it's over.

Unthinkable, I know, but she is attracted to and interested in other guys.

7506
Wow that's pretty interesting. I'd imagine they don't have many guys in their life seeing if they'd be a fit for the guy - i.e. I'm sure every guy is just hoping she thinks the guy is a good fit. I've tried to implement that style in my relationships now -&gt; seeing myself as the prize and testing her to see if she is a good fit for me.

Very attractive quality for a guy to have.

11423
I never thought about this but you may be right. I know 35 year old guys who look 25. On the other hand, I know overweight 30 year old balding guys who look like they're 45.

4017
These women prey on lonely guys they can use.  The guys who promote the single moms have no other options, so when she pushes him, it's either go back to a life of no sex, or give in.

Which is why she goes for such desperate guys in the first place.  She knows that guy will never find anyone else, and that's exactly who she was looking for.  If she wants a good looking guy, the complete opposite of the guy she "dates", she can do him on the side.  She won't push for a relationship with him because he, in contrast to the guy she's "dating", can find someone else.

If you got into a long term relationship with someone who already had children and you raised those kids for 18 years, they would still be your kids in your mind. Biologically no but he was still the only father they ever really knew. To those children and how their lives were impacted, their real dad was nothing but a sperm donor.

10651
He would probably be just as well off if not more so financially if the mother would stay at home with the kid and there's no doubt that the kid would be better off.

2815
If the feminine imperative says that real men take care of their kids. I agree with that and I hope all men do. There are too many kids without fathers and are being raised by single mothers. That last thing we need is someone to read this and think that it’s BP to take care of their kids. 

15384
this.  never get formally married.  if you don't want kids, never cohabitate... just stay fit and fuck 22 year olds.  if you want kids, get a surrogate or a cohabitation agreement that expressly says you're not married.

16474
Same. Kids or too broke. Parents had 4 Kids, dad a 5th with another woman (never got to see, paid child support though) and they both had close to minimum wage jobs. So they weren't wrong...but they were wrong to have that many kids.

13939
For all the older guys here, how does this work with having kids? Idk if there’s a way you can do this with the mother of your kids? Just thinking ahead, no kids yet :) but I’m approaching that age.

5981
I am 13 years older than my youngest sibling, there are six of us total. By the time I had my own kids at 25, I was an old hand at taking care of kids. If I have four kids with me all day, they're all going to be reading, doing math, and knowing everything they're going to need in life before they turn 8. I had my oldest daughter reading at 3, she was also running Windows 3.1 at the same age. By 5 she was able to do all kinds of things other kids her she never dreamed of.  Her cousins can't do what she has done. I wad just starting with the younger one when their mom went stupid and ran off. Only had taught her the alphabet and how to count.

That's while I was working 70 hours a week in a factory running cnc lathes, and I was also teaching them about cars and tools in my garage as I built and repaired things to make extra cash.

Taking care of kids is painfully fucking easy, unless you're an incompetent loser. Establish who is the boss, and they're very easy to handle. Scream at them like my sister does, and they'll walk all over you, like her kids do to get. They know when I'm there bullshit doesn't fly.. The reason we have girls stay home and take care of kids is because there's not much more most of them can handle. If they went about tracing the kids and making it fun like I did, rather than putting them in front of a tv, you know engage the kids and get them excited to learn, then they'd have time to do all the inane bullshit they want, like Facebook.

Might be that I had already been through a war that made everything in life after it seem eat before I had kids. Might be that a rough life with younger siblings made me a far better dad than my own. Could be that I'm smarter than most people and so are my kids. Whatever it is, I rarely have trouble with other people's kids. Adults on the other hand, holy fuck what a bunch of idiots I deal with daily.

Im 49, recently divorced with no kids. I dated a really wonderful woman with two kids, she was rich even. I just didn't want to put the time investment into someone else's kids. Im older so I don't have unlimited time like you younger kids ��  Im not cynical and jaded like a lot of these kids but I caution you to be careful ��

I can't imagine how someone would rather raise a kid shitty way than not have a kid, just because he wants a kid. That's egoistic as fuck. Myself I' won't  have a kid if I can't give him the absolute best - my time, custom home schooling, good environment. I've already 

6757
Haha so true. She actually suckered a guy into marrying her and adopting the first kid. Few months later she divorced him and now has the dumbass paying her child support for a kid that’s not even biologically his. That’s what the white knight life will get you. Meanwhile the first kids Dad has no clue the kid exists. And we’re talking about a kid that’s 11.

That means he had no frame to begin with. Blue pill or red pill, cuck or pussy slayer, getting fat just because your wife is means you gave up on yourself. He can't blame her. If she wants to get diabetes that's on her.

It is "Red Pill" (aka "Alpha") to do whatever the fuck you want.  It is NOT "Red Pill" to seek approval for doing what it is that you want.

This makes The Red Pill look fucking terrible and immature, if this is what it means to you boys... I'm out! Where's The Red Pill subreddit for men? 

11554
You don’t see that the model works for the red pill world as well. It validates red pill as rational and blue pill as irrational. No matter what prior probabilities you use

Imagine the year is 2010 you for some reason took the Bitcoin Red Pill and invested heavily when the price was $1. Now what happens when you tell your Boomer Family about the tremendous potential of Bitcoin because of its ability to cheaply quickly and quietly move money transnationaly?

Imagine hitting your Boomer Family with the Bitcoin Red Pill in 2010, 

Or *Jet Fuel Can't Melt Steal Beams* Red Pill, 

Or the *Let's Short Enron Red Pill* 

Or the *Hillary isn't going to win because her polls are based on the deluded belief that Blacks are gunna vote for her like they did for Obama*

What I'm saying is there is a whole class of information completely incomprehensible to normies. This is a historical fact, one that has been discussed since Plato.

Which is to say the Red Pill is one Red Pill amongst thousands. Don't make the mistake of fetishising it.

You won't regret missing your cruise on the Titanic. Trust me.

Everytime some shit goes down with women, i fuck up or chad comes along. I think to myself - this is the red pill, gotta swallow the red pill

Not sure why it’s being downvotes either. Some guys on here will act like they’ve been red pilled since they were born, but almost all American boys are force fed blue pills from an early age. It’s not easy swallowing the red pill in its entirety, and many of us have probably experienced a situation in which we opened up too much and let ourselves deviate from the red pill path.

16081
I think one of the biggest parts of the red pill is learning self control and always staying present. But I see the red pill as the actual red pill for life, not just female nature and sexual strategy as normally discussed here.

#What is upstream red pill? 

So are these guys people who advocate for spirutally uplifting sluts and saving them from whoring themselves out?

They claim to be better than the red pill - how so?

Why do Red Pill super stars support some upstream people?

For example - Gay Lube oil and IllimitableMan both support some guy named AJA Cortez on twitter, but AJA Cortez actively bashes, criticizes, and hates the red pill - he calls rollo a bitch. So why do GLO and IllimitableMan support that guy if he hates the red pill?

Are GLO and ILLM just shills for upstream red pill?

What is upstream red pill? 

17235
Well thats why men are either blue pilled or enraged red pills and then later somewhat calmer red pills. 

Blue pill is a male projection of what he needs onto reality. enraged red pill is when you are smart enough to realize its a mirage and you feel like youve been lied to about the mirage. Calm red pill is when you are getting your dick sucked.

Im not sure I could tolerate getting my dick sucked with my current understanding of women. Its the uncanny valley for me. Do you know what that is?

Most music tends to guide your emotions, so you're not "working through your emotions" - you're taking a piece of music and using it as "what should I feel now" guideline to put you in an emotional state.

There's absolutely no need (and no benefit) in feeling more angry (or resentful or frustrated and so on) during anger phase. 


&gt;And after every release I feel stronger and more capable than before.

Yes, you do "feel stronger and more capable", but in reality you're not. You just "feel like it" and that's b/c nothing changed in reality, only your feelings did. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I feel the transition from boyhood into manhood and feel grateful. I cry.

This thread is equivalent of a girl crying herself to sleep after a breakup. 

Next time DO something constructive like gym or gaming some girls.

Don’t let your emotions influence where you think you are at, i.e. oh I’m feeling sad, I must not be over her, oh ok, I’m not over her, that’s right. 

Our emotions and thoughts can be in contradiction all the time. For example, there was a military general who said cowardice is not when you feel fear at the front lines, it’s when you act on it. That’s to say it’s completely normal to feel fear in that situation, it’s about what you do with it though.

Same situation here, it’s completely normal to feel sad after a break up. Don’t worry about changing that feeling. You know what’s the best way to make a feeling go away? To not think about it and to keep calm and carry on. It’s like if you told someone to not think about penguins, they’re gonna keep accidentally thinking about penguins. Best way to not have penguins come to mind anymore is to do something else. And if it just so happens that something reminds you of penguins again (i.e. sadness), that doesn’t mean anything about you and work you need to do on yourself.

Watch out for the stories you attach yourself to. Let yourself feel sad, but write your own stories instead of letting your emotions write them.

Right? At first I felt good because I didn’t get hit and they backed up when confronted me and I didn’t feel bad for them, but felt like an idiot afterwards for some reason, probably because it was a stupid situation and my brother could have gotten hurt

When I broke up with my girl I said that I felt too insecure being in a relationship (which was half true, the real reason was because she was an untrustworthy hoe, and that'll make any man's cuck-prevention instincts kick in).

This worked perfectly because she can't change how I feel, she can't feel like there's anything wrong with her (as i made the "feels" about myself), and she feels like she has some superiority over me if I appear vulnerable (which decreases the chances of petty revenge, etc.)

There was some post about how if you act beta, she'll be disgusted and want to break up with you, so use that to your advantage, just say you're an insecure bitch and it'll make the breakup go along much smoother.

If you act like some cool motherfucker who doesn't need her anymore and makes her feel worthless (which exactly how I felt but I chose not to act that way), she'll feel the need to get her revenge so she won't feel so small, and that'll come back to bite you.

13649
Very well said! Saying No for me was/Is one of the hardest i had to learn,  I still sometimes feel bad for saying no, But with time No will be normal to use when i don’t feel like doing something.

More Jim Jonesing.  Don't even pretend that you "don't feel."  Even psychopaths, feel.  You have *come to terms* with reality, but that doesn't mean you never felt or could not imagine what many or most men feel here.

Enough of your bullshittery.

*Sigh*.

I am not straight but I know how you feel.

I found someone once, ages ago, that I thought I loved. More than anything. He was beautiful, he was sweet. I wanted him so badly. It felt like I was on fire wanting him. Pure Hell, 24/7. I got it in. And I got to know him. And I realized I felt *nothing* for him.

And that was worse. When I felt pain and anger, at least I felt something. After that I just felt nothing and empty. How do you even know you're alive if you don't feel anything?

11209
I see what you mean. I do want to "look the bit" for a little part. I feel like everyone should, at least once in their lives, to see how you feel and how your body feels.

Those disses are one form of shit-tests in the particular scenario you describe.  'Shit-test' is just a broader term that could encompass a lot more than a direct insult.  It's basically anything a woman throws at you for the sake of gauging your alpha traits from your response.


A pressure-flip is a technique for passing a shit-test.  Basic example: 

- Woman you're seeing complains why you aren't paying for her (relatively low-effort shit test)

- "I thought *you* asked me out for this.  Shouldn't the one asking be the one who pays?" (flips the pressure so now she has to make the excuse not to pay)

6502
I picked up vaping recently because the nicotine is a useful supplement to go with my regular stimulant medication (and studies show that it's effective).

All sorts of people have been trying to give me shit for it. It's great practice for deflecting shit tests; I even remind people that I vape when the conversation is appropriate, subtly inviting them to try and poke even more. It doesn't last long when they realise how much I don't give a shit.

It's a lame example, but saying shit like "I chuck phat clouds every day" is a good way to agree and amplify IMO.

Edit: I'm not suggesting everyone should pick up vaping; I did it because I have ADHD and the nicotine could be useful for me. If you do want to vape, then sure, try it out; it's a personal choice. It just happens to give me good practice for shit tests, because as we all know, vaping is looked down upon.

10886
You should've said "I can't work around a maybe, it's a yes or no"

Sometimes girls use the word "maybe" as a shit test. I learned to look for it. Usually they say yes

The #1 rule in dealing with people being assholes, being arrogant, or making fun of you when it comes to surface level interaction:

Laugh.

Find humor in it. Humor provides a level of detachment, of separation and enjoyment. **When someone’s fucking with you, if you are taking it seriously, you’ve already lost.** The more seriously you take it and the more worked up you get, the more they relish in having control over you. The more worked up **they** get and the more funny **you** find it, the more in control of the situation it puts you. The key is to shift the power dynamic. Find genuine humor in it. 

People can tell when something has pierced your emotional defenses and is pissing you off. Being angry is vulnerable- it means something got to you. People will pounce on it. I’m not saying never get angry or never take certain situations seriously; if there is actual conflict that needs your engagement, by all means, take it seriously, get angry, and at that point if people give you shit for getting worked up it won’t matter because the situation matters enough to you that you don’t care if you get made fun of. Cultivate yourself so that when important conflict arises, you are not afraid to stand up and face it. But surface level interactions, like shit tests, people making passes at you, and social annoyances are not the time nor the place for that. It just displays emotional weakness. 

If you get upset, make a big deal about it, and fail the shit test, people will note that you are emotionally weak. But more importantly than that, you ARE emotionally weak. With passing shit tests, the emphasis is often placed on the opinions of others and not wanting to lose face, and that is important, but more important is the state of YOUR being, and being able to deflect shit tests and not only *come across* like it doesn’t bother you, but for it to *actually not bother you*. Would you rather have people think nothing bothers you but it actually does, or have people think something got to you but it really didn’t? When you get good at passing shit tests, both externally AND internally, you can have the best of both worlds- where nothing bothers you and everyone knows it.

**Externally** passing shit tests is what is you can read about in the sidebar- the techniques and things to say to deflect shit tests verbally, to not show any signs of weakness or vulnerability. Agree and amplify, pressure flip, etc… my favorite low effort one is when someone tries to insult you and you can tell they’re reaching a little bit far, and so you just look at them, and let it sit in silent for a second… raise your eyebrows like you would when looking at a puppy and thinking 'awww', maybe even give them a condescending pat on the back as if to say *"Nice try,”* and let them stew in their own embarrassment of a backfired shit test. Point is, externally passing shit tests is what you do to show others you were not phased by it.


**Internally** passing shit tests is what you actually feel. If after an interaction you are thinking about what the person said and are feeling upset by it, you find yourself growing angry, you have internally failed. It means you have too much self-doubt, to the point that you are basically shit testing yourself, and subconsciously asking yourself *“What if what they said is right… what if my taste in music DOES suck? What if my mom IS a whore? Maybe I AM a bitch.”* The part that probably bothers you the most is not just the fact that you were shit tested, but the fact that you felt like you failed it. And that you watched yourself fail it- you saw the limits of your being in that moment and saw your insecurity and inadequacy shine forth. If you feel like this after a shit test- regardless of how well you handled yourself, regardless of whether or not the people present felt that you passed it- you failed. Because you’re thinking about it. And it’s bothering you. So what do you do?

The first step is to be honest and admit that it is bothering you. If you lie to yourself to act tough you will just feel like more of a bitch. Acknowledge that, at least in this situation, and probably in other avenues of your life, you are a bitch. Once you acknowledge this there is a sense of freedom- there is no holding onto ego, there is no “ma alpha fucks” bullshit, it’s just you being honest with yourself: you failed a shit test. It pissed you off. It’s bothering you. You are not as mentally strong as you want to be, and you want to get better, you want to be stronger, so that next time a similar situation comes up you will be able to deflect it and not give a fuck, and leave the other person looking like a bitch. But to get to where you want to go, you have to figure out where you are. Right now the bitch is you. Good. Now you are at square one.

Where do you go from here? 

Realize that everything you’re feeling is just insecurity. Realize everyone has insecurity. Even Chad, at some point, has undoubtedly failed a shit test, and was ruminating it over in his mind that night getting pissed off and feeling like a bitch. Everyone feels insecurity to some extent. There is one (primary) root cause of insecurity: you do not believe you are adequate. You do not believe you are good enough, you’re not good enough to be the kind of person you want to be, and because of that you do not respect yourself.

You **can** cultivate a state of mind and self-image that does not care about petty things- insults people throw at you, words spoken by people who are probably more insecure than you- these things do not have to bother you. They do not have to have power over you. And this starts with having discipline, building yourself up to be someone you respect, keeping your promises to yourself, sticking to decision you’ve made- if you repeatedly tell yourself you want to start working out, start eating healthier, start doing better in college or at your job, and you never do, or maybe you’ll get on it for a week and then quit, you will not respect yourself. Respect is earned, not given, and likewise you cannot just *give* yourself your own respect. You have to **earn** your own respect. Respect is subconscious. And you earn it through maintaining your frame; through making decisions, and having the discipline to follow the fuck through on them. Don’t sit around all day talking; DO something. While someone else is busy and trying to build themselves an empire of words to live in and feel good about themselves, you can be out there DOING things- pump that fucking iron, eat those vegetables and chicken breasts, get out there and make yourself a king- ESPECIALLY when you don’t feel like it. If you only grind when you feel like grinding, that’s not discipline; that’s just you doing what you feel motivated to do in the present moment.

tl:dr By cultivating discipline and following through on the things you know you should be doing, you will earn your self-respect and you will feel confident, and when people try to put you down, you won’t give a fuck. Because you’re too busy living your life and basking in self-validation to care. Externally or verbally passing shit tests is the easy part- just know some words to say. And you should know how to verbally pass shit tests. But passing the ultimate shit test- the quiet one, the shit test that your own subconscious is doing to you, poking your frame, trying to see if you are someone who is worthy of your own respect- THAT is the ultimate shit test you should be trying to pass. And the only way to pass is to have discipline, so that when it's time to grind and do the things you know you should be doing and you hear that little devil floating next to you saying "nahh, just relax, it's too much effort" or "ah, you didn't really want it that bad anyway," you smack that bitch to the ground and you DO what you need to do.

All of that and more is within your grasp.

Now get off the internet and go work out.

Alpha males &amp; Sigma males are usually born. But a significant minority of them were forcibly bluepilled from childhood and only broke free from their psychological chains in adulthood. Like an elephant that was chained by the foot since it was a calf. A smaller minority are Betas who have both awakened and ascended to a higher level of manhood. The alpha male is more socially active and charismatic while the sigma male is more aloof and cold. The alpha hunts like a lion while the sigma hunts like a leopard. 

Beta males are natural, but many of them are artificial constructs by a twisted society to suppress their alpha potential. This is everyone from fedoralords, to feminist liberal manginas, to tradcucks obsessed with chivalry, to that great unfortunate minority of sweet tempered but naive dudes who actually drank the Kool-Aid about “Be nice 2 girls and they’ll love you for being kind”. May or may not have had an alpha father, but his genetic influence was weak or non-existent. Younger boys out of brothers tend to be more beta. More attached to mommy than daddy usually. If she’s a single mom then she will brainwash the fuck out of him in an attempt to spite the alpha who smashed and dashed on her. “Men are fucking pigs! Dont be a pig! Don’t be like your no-good father! You pull chairs for girls and put your jacket on puddles for them!”. If alpha father IS in the picture he was probably distant and failed to pass down alpha wisdom and techniques. A beta male gets very upset during confrontations and scares easily. Likely the defective autismo obligation child of a post-wall hag and her beta provider. 

Gamma males are usually created. They’re beta males who got stuck in the anger phase. They are furious at women for being what they are and furious at themselves for their inability to touch a vagina without force or cash. Such men were usually raised by domineering or violent thundercunt mothers and pussywhipped beta fathers. Likely to have rage issues at this point. The ranks of rapists, stalkers, and violently possessive boyfriends are gamma males. They both hate and love women, just as they hate and love themselves. The gamma male will sometimes lash out at alphas or sigmas, and quickly be put down by all present. Imagine the whiny guy from every survival flick who wants to be the leader and works against him until his plot is discovered. These are the Elliot Rogers of the world. 

Omega males are Chris Chan tier. Never had a snowball’s chance in hell. Resigned to life in the basement, making tender love to his Onahole and Hentai manga. Maybe periodically leering at anything with XX chromosomes that passes the window outside. The more self aware ones will mourn their lot in life and probably suicide soon. These men often have a myriad of mental problems that make them untouchable, or have genuine disfigurements indicating fucked up genes. Some will give up and find other desires, others go prisongay, the remainder might escape into video games and other fantasy worlds. Omegas often have non-existent or utterly selfish fathers while being nurtured by an overindulgent mother that handwaves his flaws until it’s too late. Being raised by grandparents is common too. Expect some level of abuse in the past.

Beta isn't a term that's exclusive to TRP. Even some of the most bluepill folks out there know that there is an Alpha - Beta separation.

Beta is a joke all its own across the Internet (fedoras, neckbeards, m'lady) of course she knows about Beta's. There's no point in sharing RP wisdom with her, she's oblivious to it.

9334
and it's only really a noteworthy thing when it's a beta trying to get away with what an alpha would get away with.  that's when they lawsuits come out

The way I think about it, woman have a dual sexual strategy and the traits that speak to one leg of it are alpha, and traits that speak to the other are beta.

If we take two beta traits like money and supplication, then money is a good beta trait with no downsides. It’s still beta, it won’t generate the tingles that alpha traits do, but it is something women want in a man. Supplication is a bad beta trait since it is also anti-alpha, and women despise low-alpha men.

When we talk about someone being a beta, what we really mean is someone who has very weak alpha and relies solely on his beta traits to interest women (which is a weak as fuck sexual strategy and basically aaying “exploit me and treat me like shit”). Just having money certainly doesn’t make you beta in that sense.

3439
I feel like the over dramatization of beta qualities in media/pop culture is due to the fact that anyone representing these qualities is already Alpha by default. 

The actors who play the white knight lead roles, the rock stars that sing about pining for some chick... these men/characters are already very Alpha in both looks and status, so when beta BS comes from their mouths, it's seen as attractive because it balances out their already alpha state into that "mostly alpha but some beta" balance that makes women swoon. 

These men are the idols for the younger generation, who don't realize that beta game only works if you're already super alpha. Then you have a slew of teens who preach the same beta morals they see in the movies, but don't have the alpha super hero powers or good looks to back them up. 

14922
That's a similar strategy to primates too.  The Beta male chimps will sneak in and have sex with the females while the alpha male is away or distracted.  They will rush in finish the act quickly and get out, so they would never confront the alpha male.  These non-alphas would then get their genes raised by the alphas. Back during the caveman days this was likely still the strategy.  However, over time it has segued into the beta bux strategy for passing on genes.  

5343
I have an issue with this but it is mainly resolved through use of terminology. Money is not beta, and AB (Alpha Bucks) is the ideal goal for any man. Is Vladimir Putin, Mike Tyson or Donald Trump a mix of alpha and beta? HEEELLLLLL NO!! They are alpha as fuck and loaded. Do you think Rameses II or Ghengis Khan were in any way beta? They had unlimited power and resources (and therefore bitches). Resources/ money is not inherently beta, it is just the only strategy available to the beta. Do not conflate money, power and resources with beta, this is one of the ongoing mistakes made by many in the manosphere. I don’t give a fuck that some of the retarded books in the MRP sidebar use the terminology of mixing beta with your alpha. Those book were written by beta, non red pilled men, do an image search of Athol Kay if you don’t believe me.

13187
Alpha and beta are terms you can throw around these days and most people will get it. If he's with his sister and points to some beta shit and says "that's some beta shit" she'll pick up on it.

9971
Alpha fucks beta bucks doesn’t mean that alphas get all the sex and betas get none. 

Alpha fucks get sex for fun. 
Beta bucks get sex for their resources. 

5051
&gt; That's what most alphas do in the animal kingdom

Wrong, mammal alphas don't lock down anything, they just have it because they are biggest and strongest, betas challenge them for mating rights. They don't signal to the betas that they have to challenge them, if they want some of his harem, the females signal that by fervently resisting their advances.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc

This is more like whats going on, the alpha walks around doing alpha sh*t, and the least beta of the betas walk up and challenge him (and obviously loses, because he's a small beta).

Yeah, it's one of those cases where you need to integrate redpill to your life before it's too late.

Makes you think doesn't it? How many life's did this Reddit page has managed to saved?

I agree 100% with you, I'm a younger guy and I plan to live my life like this. The only concern I have is what to do when you are old? Having children can help you during the last years of your life. And if you are going to say that living the last years of your live as a rich old man is not so bad I agree with you but I want to know if you have another plan like marrying at an old age

Strokes and heart attacks happen for a reason. Don't be an idiot, it's not a scripted event of your life, that "will happen". Life is like a bank balance, so if you don't start saving (literally your life), then the time will be soon up for you. Clean your diet, hell.. maybe even go vegan, if possible. Don't stay in a stressful job, no matter how much you make from it. Life is too short for you to settle, that doesn't serve you. There is a reason, people life past 100 today.

&gt; Your life sounds just so good. Everything so idealistic and wonderful that it screams of bullshit.

..and your opinion matters for what reason? I'm living this life, I don't need to prove it. Certainly not idealistic, they're just the highlights of my lifestyle that I've managed to achieve by "taking charge of my life", as you put it.

Do tell us how you've taken charge of your life recently, because as it stands, and looking at your post history, you just seem like a man with a lot of words and no action.

Very reckless. 

Life is hard enough as it is and You just made enemies for no good reason. 

If those guys ever get into a power position over you even if it’s just circumstantial-you’re fucked. 

Not a way to live life people. 

Help &amp; grow, don’t antagonize unnecessarily.

You're still wanting the Disney fairytale. I know how it ends, the same way it always does. Get used to it. 

Get yours, enjoy the time you get with people because they aren't going to be in your life forever. There will come a day when it's the last time you see them, that's how life works.

You're not going through the motions, you're getting what you want from life. Fucking hot girls is fun,, enjoy it for what it is and forget the idea that you want to keep her. Every girl I wanted to fuck 20 years ago has zero chance at even seeing my dick, I'll fuck her daughter though. I have more important shit to do in my life, more fun things too, and girls soak up the time and resources i need to do those things.

Get used to it, that's life man.

The issue is that newbies take many posts  (especially the angry ones that they relate to) at face value. People need to understand that this is TRP *Theory* not *law*. Nothing is an absolute. TRP is not to be read as a manual to life, it is moreso a guidebook. It is a good source of information to set you in the right direction but not to dictate exactly how you live your life. 

Why is it not good to expect to have TRP tell you exactly how you should live? Simply because life is so complex that no generic tips or advice will apply to every person reading it. Everyone is different. Life is precious and limited just try to enjoy it while it lasts. Redpill can increase your quality of life, but like all other things in life it is used best in moderation.

8214
&gt; Life's for living, not preparing for death.

The time I write about is definitely a part of life and it is necessary to plan for it.

What is this handbook you are talking about? Living life via some mythical "handbook" is not a way to live. 

&gt;do we have a place for living? yes.

2 years of this "handbook" and you missed the part about not cohabitating...

8573
I’m new to the red pill and I’m using the way in normal life like with woman at Work and girls I know 
It works 
You just have to read and make sure you apply what you learned in real life experience 
A woman is not the goal it’s something along the way with what comes with your new out look on life 
Don’t try and think you have frame then when a woman talks to you, you break and lose it 
Try hard to be with what you have in your mind and stay with it 
I am and it’s making my life better 
Go with your life and do what you want and don’t be a pussy and go with the flow when you don’t want to 
Follow your own path and stick with it

What the fuck man. I would honestly slap my friends for doing something like this. I told my best friend his girlfriend was a whore in grade 9 because she fucked half the guys in the school. He didn't appreciate it at the time, but after when he woke up he thanked me for being straight with him. 

If I was you I would have told your friend she's fucking at least one of those guys. Who gives a shit how he reacts he's your friend. 

16066
well some parts of the story seem like b/s but anyway lol I had similar situation..

actually twice..


first time, this super religious girl that goes to church every sunday and participates in all activities and always talks about god and how she doesn't want to sin, at the same time constantly partying and swearing I had kinda confused opinion about her, at one hand she was super loyal to god and good, on the other hand she was partying and drinking..


so we ended up at my friends place, she was friend of my friends ex gf, we stayed over at friends house as well, and when it was time to get ready to sleep I jokingly said that we can sleep together, and she was like sure.. in the end we banged and it was quite easy, later she had a random bf and got a child from him, and it seems like she slept with multiple people I know, so now she is dating one of my friends.. well he used to be my friend but some how we lost contact, it kinda feels weird but nobody has said anything to him so far...




and another time, my friend was in love with this girl, but she was kinda insecure so would always bring her friend with her everywhere.. so my friend never had the opportunity to stay 1-1 with her.. so he asked for my help.. so the plan was for me to distract this girl, so that my friend &amp; his crush can stay 1-1..


so my friends crush had a bf, she was religious as well, I didn't know what to do to lure her away... so she was saying how much she is doing gymnastics and how damaged her back is.. I just said that im chiropractic(I don't have a clue about massage and never did it before lol), so she got interested and I offered her to help, I mean as we got in to it she took of her shirt and said that she really likes it(prolly because she was a bit tipsy), and then I got kinda excited as well and started massaging her legs and booty as well, she didn't really mind it so we banged...


so yeah I don't really know but pulling those two religious girls was easier than any other girl.


or when

&gt; a friend is going to stick up for her friend

call bs on that. A lying friend will stick up for a liar. But then again you're women, you don't understand the value of honesty.

I thank God for my best friend. I had honestly given up on male friendships. 95% of Men are shitty, self-centered, bitchy, flaky, unreliable and petty. At one time I thought there was something wrong with me till I met my current best friend and I realised there are respectable men still left. We have been friends for over 2 years now. He is working, I have just finished college so he is more financially stable than me. The guy paid for my graduation party expenses and hired a vehicle that carried my family. Even my parents were surprised. In case am not well-off financially and we want to go out, he will deliberately give me money before we hit the club so that the girls think we are sharing the costs. He may be beta but he says he would rather spend money on a dude than waste it on a bitch. This is a code he lives by and he has even offended some women by telling them these straight to their face. I recently met some gay dudes at a fashion event. One of them was hitting on me. I told him I am flattered but I don't get down like that and he said he doesn't mind, we can still be friends. I knew he still wanted to fuck me and I only agreed because I saw them with a group of pretty women and that was a good opportunity to game them. Anyway, the next weekend he invites me out. I meet him outside the club and find him with some other friendsThese all experience made me remember where I was a few years ago-with shitty male friends. Usually when I go to the club with my best friend, the first thing we do is ensure everyone is seated otherwise we will all stand somewhere and wait. We will also stick together throughout the night even if him or me meet other people we know. Now, back to the gay dudes. We go inside the club, they spot a group of girls they know at a table, two of them seat at the two empty seats remaining leaving the rest of us standing. They start talking to these girls without bothering where the rest of us are gonna seat. The other gay fuckers disappear in the crowd for over 30 minutes, leaving me alone with one other guy. Throughout the night, they keep coming back and disappearing. Seriously? What's wrong with these people? These has been my experience with all other male friends I have had in the past. Come to think of it, even straight males are not any different from feminine homosexual males. There is one friend I had like 3 years ago, he was popular in the club scene. The guy would immediately ditch me and spend the entire night trying to convince a girl to go home with him only to come back occasionally after one hour to sip his drink. This was despite telling him I don't like what he is doing and he would rather not invite me out again if he is gonna ditch me.



These are only a few examples. Have had friends that tried hitting on my girlfriend while I was drunk, tell other people personal stuff we had shared in private, flake on me at the last minute after we made plans, try to neg or one man up me in the presence of girls etc. You don't need these shitty people in your life. I always thought I have to be friends with as many people as possible in order to be build a solid social circle. It took me time to realise these is useless unless you are engaging them purely on a business platform. Grown men who lack an iota of masculine dignity and respect should be avoided at all costs. They will cost you in the end. I know people who have lost their jobs after being betrayed by their jealous male friends. Lastly, be careful who share with your personal issues, otherwise, they will be used against you by those same male friends you trust.




Edit: For those concern trolling me, let me clarify, my best friend is straight, we have been friends for over two years so I should know. The gay dudes that I hanged out with once are not my friends. I am not a homophobe like you and if hanging out with gay men once means getting easy access to HB9s then fuck yeah, I am gonna do it. Am also not financially dependent on my best friend like some of you are trying to insinuate with your psychoanalysis. I have helped him a few times too when he was in a fix and regularly pay for drinks when we go out. I was simply giving an example to illustrate why he is a good friend.

Deadbedrooms is a sad place.  If a woman is good for all besides sex and is your best friend, let her be your best friend, but it's time to find a new partner.

  // , With you on this, and our culture has more need of the "suffer in silence" mentality. But I'm saying that a balance of complaining and action CAN BE FRIENDS.

&gt; There are exceptions like needing advice about a specific field a friend knows a lot about and asking their opinion but that is not what this post is about.

This post completely ignores the exceptions you mentioned. Plus, you might never know that a friend knows a lot about something.

There are even cases where your friends knowing about your problems can lead to better outcomes, as long as you are willing to seriously consider your friends' actions or advice on your behalf. Complaining and action CAN BE FRIENDS:

&gt; Fat? Go exercise. Your friends don't need to hear about how you are upset you are fat.  

I did this (complained about how I never seemed to gain muscle). My friends referred me to their lifting friends, and gave me invitations to the gym. Which I accepted. 

&gt; Don't like your job? How will telling people you hate your job fix anything? Get a different job.

"Hey, I remember from last week you were saying you hated your job. I assume you've been looking, so I shared your contact info with a friend who's a hiring manager."

My mild, very occasional sarcasm to friends about annoying parts of my job actually lead to some Bitcoin work, since a friend piped in about a startup of his.

&gt; Dog died? What will telling people you are sad about your dead dog do? Nothing productive. You probably just want sympathy and are being weak.

Hm. Yeah, this is a case where "suffer in silence" is the best way to go. Unless your friends have some puppies for you, I guess.

Honest complaining among people who take action upon complaints results in better solutions than if there was no complaining at all.

EDIT: No one is saying that women will find complaining or ANY sympathy attractive. This is strictly for men where you have a history of helping each other and whom you trust, in moderation.

i have too. on both sides. i've had friends fuck girls who i played the long game with. pissed me off and of course i got mad at my friend and caused drama. 
now after discovering TRP principles on my own and then finding this site (reaffirming things i've learned the hard way), this shit never happens to me anymore. mainly because i don't play the long game. if i can't even get a kiss while on the first date then i'm out.  and if my friends get her first then good job, happy for you, oh look there's another girl over there who might look different on the surface but feels the same in the dark. 

and yes i've "stolen" girls from my friends the past few years a few times too and I don't feel bad about it. I know the old me would have hated the new me when it comes to that, but it's up to the new me to recognize these traits in my friends and show them how shit needs to be handled.  Yes it's possible to fuck your friend's oneitis and teach them a positive lesson at the same time and remain friends.  

9672
&gt;I don't know how to feel about this. I talked with my best friend about it and both of us are just confused.

I wonder if the friend is male or female.

9846
&gt; Make friends and make friends of your friend

I've never been able to randomly make friends in my entire life. I understand that this is important, but at 27 with a fulltime job taking three courses and school. It isn't easy. Its not easy at all, close to impossible to start friends from scratch. I dunno man, I agree with you, it's just probably the hardest thing on TRP. Cold approaching is much easier.

I was surpised too,  since she has seemed very nice. But i think she is just show off too her friend when she is with her.

Okay sure, "creepy" or not is a judgment call.

But he was indeed just playing the game. Do you even deny this?

Simply put, a man playing video games is not sexually attractive to a woman.  You can play them, you can play them all you want, just don't do them in front of your woman.  

A woman watching a man play video games is like a man watching a woman eating big macs.  It's that repulsive.  It's how the sexual dynamics work.  And I love playing video games.

16865
Yeah, warhammer gamer... I obsess about the aspect of my life I cannot change, while you post incessantly on gamer subs.

You are definitely ooler because you are taller and a gamer.

I acquiesce. Your height alpha destroys my game alpha.

&gt;That “enthusiastic consent” is a new ambiguously defined terminology, and part of the larger narrative meant to further confuse and instill fear in men.

i'd like to know what their end game is? what do you feel WILL be there and game? how do you see the next 5-10 years playing out and do you think they even know what their end game is? or are they just " seeing what they can get away with?"

1289
&gt; Or, it just means that you don't want to play the game. Sometimes the best way to win the game is not to play at all.

Copout hamstring. You don't want to play a game in which you will lose against cool Chad with his cool, popular instagram account and lambo pics.

4667
I cold approach all the time and it works very well for me. That being said I only approach if:

1. She is attractive enough that I would regret not approaching
2. She gives me a IOI.

This goes for day and night game. I DO NOT spam approaches and I DO NOT just run up to random women on the street and step in front of them.


15579
Good post. 

Social circle game is nothing but network marketing pussy. It is a lot more efficient than running direct sniper approach game. 

People have no idea how truly easy it is to get set up with comp tables and bottles at nightclubs and how much easier the game gets from having your own or sitting at somebody else's. 

Photographer and promoter game is almost cheating in terms of fucking hot pussy with the amount of game you actually employ on them. ROI is insane.

Women don't approach my friend. But if you asked which guy would have the more successful approach, I'd say the one who had his game down to a T. Naturally Mr. Stallone will have more confidence and that will drive his game further

2068
I cannot agree enough. I've had a very successful relationship so far doing the same thing OP and what this comment suggests. 


Once you figure out that's how the game works, you play by it. 


"Whether or not you want to play the game, the game will be played" -someone, probably

4571
Best advice I've seen on here about game. 

Running direct spam approach "natural game" is the fucking worst form of game and in my opinion for peasants. I don't even consider it game. 

Sad this type of game is still getting taught and used. If you need to approach 30 women in a day just to fuck one, you don't have game.

She didn't want you because you couldn't get your dick up... Lol. Not for any other reason than you fucked up in that regard. If she only wants sex, and you can't provide her with good sex. Why the fuck is she going to come back for more and not go looming elsewhere? 

13578
Post wall women are ONLY good for the sex, if you can stomach being completely indifferent to their feelings. Because it’s that desperate trap you sex. OP said they’re not good lays but I don’t know what he’s talking about. The best sex I’ve ever had was always older women. But you have to ready and willing to tear them off like a bandaid because all they have at that point in their life is the sex and they’re needy and damaged as fuck. 

2415
Women **always** try to inflate their perceived value, always: before, during and after sex; before, during and even after an LTR. Basically always. Perceived value is all they have.  

They try it before sex by playing hard to get, showing their options, playing mind games, etc. 

They try it after sex by making you think there might not be a next time, or by making you work more for the same sex as before, etc. 

It’s their strategy to make you think that pussy is worth so much. 

It’s your strategy to subtly show her it isn’t. 

12784
How does this get upvoted? lol You're either a troll or something is really wrong with you.

Ann had sex with a guy she liked. She didn't like you so she didn't have sex with you. Shocker!

12100
Unless you're in the top 5%, sex will for sure be cheaper with an escort. However, it's not the same as a girl who really wants you. So TRP appraoch is still the best for good sex.

9538
If I were you, I’d promote a high sex drive plate to LTR and fuck constantly.  Don’t get too attached, just use it for sex.  Tell her you will not look at porn and keep your word gold.  This way you have an outlet, sex, and a mission, which is reinforced one and the same.

The above works for me, I haven’t looked at porn in a year, although her sex drive started above mine, so your mileage may very. 

7179
I never ever heard of any male using sex as validation.

Sex is sex to males. OP is an idiot and reading too much into it

8536
Whatever helps you sleep at night. Women like good sex. Good sex is better than bad sex. Regardless of how bad you want to hamster that away. 

4643
Several LTR's I've had were with women who never turned me down for sex once. One of them told me when we first started dating, "Just so you know I will NEVER say no to you for sex."



Her and a few others actually had sex drives even stronger than my own! Imagine 15-year old me, with one notch, and my 15-year old gf is talking dirty to me and wanting sex in public!



Sex drive mismatches can kill a relationship. Having similar libidos is a non-negotiable for me at this point in my life.



Being with a girl who doesn't want sex as much as you can really be soul-crushing. 

1151
Having sex actually pumped me up for having even more sex in the future, so I forgot about porn&amp;fap.  
I’m gonna abstain from porn&amp;fap for few weeks, with main goal to break addiction and have sex instead of using porn, so if sex happens, it’s success.

A girl who didn’t appeal to you when you had low SMV... and now you want to game them now that you have more options and a higher SMV?  

 I mean yea you can probably game them pretty easily, but why would you want to?

4370
Increasing SMV has a pretty positive correlation with living an interesting, happy, and self-fulfilling life given that *those things increase your SMV.*

If you have a high SMV you worked for, you're happy and confident. If you're unhappy, you're SMV isn't high either. And who doesn't want to be happy with their life.

9220
True, because her perception of you matters. Asshole game from a low SMV guy will come out as being a dick/angry, while from high SMV as being flirty.

5624
Characteristics of SMV: Status, Money, Looks, Fitness, HIGH SMV MINDSET.

Having a high SMV mindset alone won't save you just like having  good looks alone won't.  

People would much rather be around a guy who is broke, fit, and has a high SMV mindset, than a guy who is broke, fit, and lets people treat him like a doormat, and thinks every common person is a demi-god. 

If a guy has status, good looks and fitness he would still be acknowledged if he didn't have a high SMV mindset.

So I see high SMV mindset as one of the characteristics that make up SMV.

aka 'women like confidence in a man'


17017
Your perspective has everything to do with your smv.

Funny thing about smv, is that no one knows what it's like to be several points higher or lower than others.

Unless you go from very low smv, improve and clean up, then place several points higher in smv, you won't make the connection.

My whole game is on trp is to push guys to stop performing/pua tactics and just stop caring so much. But that perspective is mine because it reflects where my smv is currently and what works best for me. 

5490
who cares, she's a 5.

lots of less attractive girls do this type of stuff. it really has more to do with them having ridiculously high standards so they can pre-emptively reject lower SMV men before the lower SMV men have a chance to reject them.

there's nothing more painful for a woman than knowing she's unattractive. getting turned down by a low SMV guy is like a kick right in the balls because it reminds the girl that she's not attractive.

women would rather be single and tell themselves and everyone else that it's because they have such high standards and will only date high SMV men.

5799
Same thing applies to online dating and apps.  High SMV women don't use them, they already have high SMV men engaging them.  On top of that, high SMV men rarely use apps/online much, because it's much easier to get high SMV women in person where low SMV guys filter themselves out, instead of trying to make it through the noise online and on apps.

5065
&gt;your own self-esteem must be higher than hers to give her a reality check.

I definitely want to pull self esteem out from under the umbrella shared by SMV.  Self esteem is more of the fundamental way you feel about yourself and your effectiveness.  Higher or lower SMV is a ranking which depends on everyone else.

For instance, you could have a dude with massively high self esteem, but very low SMV.  Someone like Stephen Hawking for instance.  The dude *probably* has very high self esteem because of his intellect and accomplishments, but low SMV relative to everyone else.

Similarly, someone could have very low self esteem and very high SMV.  Take Tom Cruise around the time he jumped on Oprah's couch making a scene.  The dude had to make spectacles because he lacked the inner contentment typical of someone with a reasonable amount of self esteem.  But on the SMV side of things, he's a 10.

It could be said 'having higher self esteem increases the likelihood you'll have higher SMV, but having high SMV doesn't necessarily increase the likelihood you'll have high self esteem.' 







15902
&gt; I speculate that the lower SMV the woman the more they prefer aesthetics whereas the higher SMV woman prefer confidence.

That's an interesting point. To add to that, I'm thinking that women with lower self-esteem (regardless of SMV) prefer men with higher confidence (regardless of SMV) to boost them up. I see this both my experience (I'm able to pick up someone absolutely beautiful - high SMV - but not 100% confident of herself) and others (I know a female friend - she's nice, and she's dating a guy that's so insecure he's a bit of a know-it-all, but possibly to her it screams self-assurance, which she doesn't have).

Now I'm looking to date only women with high genuine self-worth, self-esteem, and yes, SMV. The trifecta!

16867
there needs to be a caution at the beginning of this only be this level of selfish if your smv is high enough for her to accept your selfishness because of your so high smv. if you have low smv she will just laugh and find someone better.

I'm not saying don't bother with money. Money will make your life, and getting laid, easier. But pretending that money makes you a sex god or irresistable to women is naive.

who cares, money is more important

But really he sells out, moves the money in an untraceable way (something like buying crypto and then shifting that to a Swiss bank account, then selling - or physically takes cash to Bermuda or the Bahamas) and then she gets another job, he gets a job schlubbing for a year or so on less money than her. Get a divorce. The lifestyle she's accustomed to is now being the breadwinner. Let's see how keen she is for 45% then.

&gt;The entire industry and the experience is designed to extract your money.

yes, the whole thing is designed to take money from dumb guys. but the OP is talking about going from the side that gets their money taken to being one of the guys taking the money. 

he's not just one of those dupes who stands in line and pays a huge cover to get in and then spends all night buying over priced drinks for girls, he's promoting and making connections to the bigger promoters/managers/owners.

&gt; Educated professional women don't get alimony 

Interestingly, they also don't want to get remarried. The female mindset is "his money is our money, my money is my money". 

&gt; *Fran Walfish, a psychotherapist in Beverly Hills, says, “a woman’s ego cannot bear to tolerate a man using her for her money"*

This is why women are so repulsed by the idea of a man being a SAHD.

"In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women"

Fair enough; I see your point. I still slightly disagree though. To me, money can be important to people and they can STILL make dumb decisions with it. Does that make sense? Valuing money doesn't automatically equal intelligence with money or getting Money.also don't forget rich people who got rich by valuing something other than money that ended up making them money...many paths to wealth and many paths to poverty. However, I do understand  your point. 
                  I'm interested to learn about  statistics on this topic. (Spending habits of lower incomes, amount of money saved in different class brackets, etc)

How did you make your money? What do you do?

Not a dox attempt, but making money is the one pillar of my life that is lagging behind. I found out too late that there's no money to be made as an engineer, it's not the 80's anymore.

Yeah lol, it's not like his talent and aspiration made him all those millions...

You know how they say for women, her money is her money, husbands money is their money. It's really funny how with a simple phrasing like that you can deduce what the person is actually thinking/talking about.

I like how she says he "came into" a lot of money. Like whoops, he got rich. It was his work with his friend that made the money.

Men are equally incapable of unconditional love unless they are boys.

Would you really want unconditional love to begin with? Love that is unconditional is meaningless and empty. If there is nothing a person can do to garner disdain does that mean their actions are all ultimately just and moral or does it mean the person judging lacks the tools required to judge?

There is one type of human love that can be called unconditional and that is mother / child. I don’t want to date my mother, thanks.

Is a dog’s unconditional love meaningful?

&gt;  tribe

A tribe cannot exceed Dunbar's number (+/- 150 individuals) for a human individual cannot characterize or remember more than this amount of humans at once. 

Moreover, men have stronger in-group preference than women and will usually organize along ethnic, national, racial and genetic lines. This is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. In studies done on bees - 17 different species of bees were mixed together and were observed to separate into 17 distinct layers along genetic lines. The same phenomenon is observed in humans - in prison fights men will first divide amongst racial lines, then ethnic/national lines, then genetic lines. Same phenomenon can even be observed in your lunch room where black males will usually stick together, so will the hispanics and the italian speakers and the russian speakers, etc.

So a tribe is a group of no more than 150 males that is distinct from other males along racial, ethnic/national and genetic lines.

&gt;Second of all what do you mean "love is for cucks" 

"Love" as we know it arose during the "Romantic era" and has served to poison the minds of society. Prior to the Romantic era (and Christianity) Love was viewed according to the four conceptions of Love as defined by the Greeks: Eros, Philia, Agape and Storge. Eros was erotic love, Philia was friendship, Agape was the love for God and Storge was familial love. This is the most accurate conception of love to exist.

The modern understanding of 'love' is believed by cucks and is made to control men and their desires. There is no 'self-sacrificing' love for a woman that society suggests - it is just a dopamine rush and if you believe in it you are a cuck.

&gt;I mean what do you expect us to do , run like machines caring about nothing at all, 

Yes

&gt;what point is there then ? 

Why does there need to be a point? What if life is pointless beyond the need to spread your seed and reproduce?

&gt;ou absolutely have no feelings such as love towards your parents,friends,ideology ,president ,sport or even money.

Absolutely. I help my family because it benefits me. I associate with friends for the same reason.

Political Ideology is for idiots and I stay away from all mainstream ideology. I choose my own that benefits me and my goals.

Why the fuck would i 'love' my president? What has he done for me that I must love him? What have been his deeds that he has earned or deserves my respect?

Why would I love sport? It benefits me in that it allows me to become strong or endurant, but how the fuck can i love sport?

I do not love money, it is merely useful in getting what i want.


&gt;nd no I don't buy the marriage crap nowadays , because for me that's a prison in itself and no I'm not putting all my money or faith on one person because that would be naive, but to say that being loving towards a person are for cucks is something I can't agree with, but your entitled to your own opinion.

Love is a prison. That is what I am trying to tell you. Love is used to imprison you, but why not use it for your own ends?

Love doesn't work that way.  Once you stop providing, the "love" dries up. Its dependancy and usury, not love.  You are simply a means to an end.  Tools are bought and used for their utility, not people.

No, I think a woman can "love" a beta but her love is based on what he provides for her and quite frankly how sexually satisfying he is.  If he no longer gives her these things, she no longer loves him.  Its not the loyal, til death do us part love that men and dogs are capable of.

The point is, men actually love women.  Women don't love men, they only love the feelings that the man gives her.  Once those feelings are gone (I love you but I'm not IN love with you), then she couldnt care less if that man got hit by a truck.  Many many women in counselling have uttered those exact words.  "My life would be better if he just didnt wake up one morning".

The ancient poet, Ovid, warned against this:  
  
**And then, how often it has happened that the man who begins by feigning love ends by falling in love in real earnest. Alas, my fair ones, look with indulgent eye on those that give themselves a lover's airs; the love, now feigned, will soon be love indeed.**

This list is a bit silly. Have you ever been in a relationship?

&gt;Never ever tell her that you love her deeply, never write too romantic letters , messages etc.

&gt; Want to express love? Say 'I like you' and stop don't glorify love too much. Women are romantic but internally in their imagination not outside.

These will make a women leave you for emotional unavailability. Read Sex God Method.

EDIT: The answer here is to say 1/3 less than her. She says "I love you". Ok, cuddle her. She says "I love you" again. Say her name like "Allice!" with a smile. She says "I love you" a third time or "I love you so much", say I love you back.

But it's definitely not never.

EDIT2: Ok, this list is the hardcore list of "The do's and don'ts if you want her to be in a relationship with you". If you tone down each point, it's somewhat useful.

I'm not saying she loves me the way I do I love her because I like loving her, she is not the only one I love though. I'm not committing away from love just because bitches do not know how to do it themselves. 

She gives me what I want when I'm with her and at those times I know she loves me when I'm away that's her own business I just do not worry about it. I take what I like from her and so does she, is she an unicorn? Hell no I know that I'm not delusional, and because I'm not delusional I can enjoy what I like while I have it. No need to be angry pal.

The problem is contingent on not only the way in which man craves to be loved, but likewise the way in which woman is capable of loving. Man desires a sacrificial love, sacrifice implies loyalty and connection. What men want from love, and what woman’s love amounts to is fundamentally irreconcilable.

In matters of love (and not simply lust,) man is an optimistic egalitarian. He loves as he wishes to be loved. In matters of love, when man is young and oblivious to the ways of women, he is a true adherent of the golden rule.

The folly of man’s nature lies in the belief that the loyalty quintessential to woman’s maternal instinct will be available within a romantic context. He believes rather foolishly, that as his mother loved him, the idealised girlfriend could. He sees how women love their children, and upon making such an observation concludes that women are capable of great love. This is true, they are. Only sadly, this great love is a love reserved solely for children, it extends not to man. As such, man has an idealisation of woman’s love, not a realisation.

Man desires that which is unattainable to him, unaware the love he desires is maternal in nature, unable to be felt for him. Nature plays a cruel trick on the psychology of man. It gives him a very pure, high quality love in his childhood. It gives him a template for woman’s love that he comes to expect as standard of all women. He is taught by his mother’s love that unconditional loyalty, noble character, gentleness, sacrifice and trust are intrinsic of the feminine essence. And so as he grows from a boy into a man he comes to the rather logical conclusion that if he is “a good man,” he can expect to be loved by his lover in much the same way. His mother, well-meant but quite incorrectly likewise affirms this notion to him. This is a wicked lie, but a man whose heart is yet to be broken does not realise this. He thinks woman’s love is immutable. He knows not that her love for child is different from that of her love for him.

And so man longs to be loved like a child, not realising such a love is reserved for children. Believing that the love he covets is romantic love, when truly it is maternal love. Such a man of course lacks the experience or nuance of mind to make this distinction. And so the tragedy for this man is learning that women do not love men like they love children. The unconditional loyalty inherent to the maternal bond is all but absent from the mating bond. Most men do not realise this. They love wholesomely right up until they are emotionally blind-sided by a woman in the most violable of ways, forced to re-evaluate their opinion of female nature. This is not a hypothetical so much as it is an eventuality. If lucky, post-breakup they end up on this site or elsewhere similar.

From there on, man can learn to re-evaluate his notion of woman’s capacity to love. He will come to learn woman’s love for her mate is of vastly reduced moral and psychological quality than that of her love for her child. How he responds to such powerful knowledge will ultimately shape what kind of man he decides to become. Be it a man going his own way, a disillusioned bachelor looking to use women for nothing but sex, or a patriarch who runs his house like a business, aware of the risk, but acting in all his power to mitigate it.

However cruel as it may seem, women are incapable of reciprocating man’s love. They love differently. There is a hierarchy of love that trickles down. Man sacrifices for woman, and woman, for child. Rarely does the river flow upward. As such, if man is to believe that women can love to the same extent as he, then he is doomed to disappointment and misery when she invariably acts within accordance of her nature rather than his idealisation.

Woman’s Love Defined: The epitome of a woman’s love is infatuation. To define it, this is a lust for your power and an obsession with how your character makes her feel, secondary to your power. It is put crudely: opportunism and emotional self-appeasement alchemised with lust.

Man oft forgets that love does not flow upward in the sacrificial sense. He makes the mistake of thinking that because he can love a woman without lusting for her, that a woman can do the same. She cannot, because her love is not based on sacrifice, it is based on the appreciation of man’s sacrifice met with lust. The more man sacrifices for a woman, the more likely he is to fall in love with his investment. The more a woman sacrifices for man absent of animal lust, the more repulsion she feels for him, interpreting her need for investment as a shortcoming on his part. And so there it is, unspoken in word but detected in sentiment; woman expects man to love her more than she loves him, reinforcing the hierarchy of love. Female sacrifice is predicated on lust and mental entrapment. Male sacrifice is expected, and freely given.

Love &amp; Female Self-Deception: A woman who does not lust for you cannot love you as you wish to be loved. Lust is the basis for her love, absent of lust you have “like” rather than “love.” Such a woman can do naught but use you and lie to you both that she is in love when she isn’t. If it is convenient for a woman to be in love, she will convince herself she is in love so that she may convince you of it. Women are masters of self-deception, so one must be extremely cautious in assigning any substance to their convictions. Treat such earnest emotional conviction as sophistry. Women are generally speaking, emotionally neurotic. Women who become too self-aware can end up hating themselves because they cannot overcome their animal elements.

&gt; You can never be sure, she actually loves you and is not settling for you.

No woman will love you the way you want them to love you.  This should never be a consideration.

Behold.  See what she says?  She wants a guy that loves her.  She doesn't say she wants a guy she loves.

But wait, it gets better.  *Her parents love him*  Does she?  Nary a word.

... and then the 10 Megaton Nuclear Hamster:  she outright says she doesn't love him.
