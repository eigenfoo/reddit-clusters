> Because why would he chase one option and make it so hard for himself when he can choose from multiple other options

I fuck many girls but they are not the same for me. There are always one that's better than the other. I have a "tits" girl. An "ass" girl and also a "Can bring to a party" girl.

All of my spontaneous threesomes have started with me being out with a girl I've hooked up with or am about to, and meeting up with an acquaintance or girl that's shown some signals, NOT a romantic interest. It needs to be a girl in town for the weekend, a friend of a friend, etc. 

Get the two girls talking by way of a gentlemanly introduction, and play up the first girl's hotness. "This is my friend Ashley, she's a former model" or whatever.

Then take first girl home and text second girl saying you're going back for a night cap and to swing by. Nothing else. 

Second girl shows up. She'll immediately talk to first girl because women are social pros. Let it go from there. If you need to encourage a bit, tell both girls they're hot and ask if they've ever dated other girls. Don't start making out with one and isolate the other.

When woman say " your not my type" that doesn't mean they won't fuck you , it just means they won't stick around to keep fucking you and they have someone who they see themselves with long term and not short.

I know his from experience and because I've done this to woman.  You can fuck one and still not be interested or you can have one good one to stick with for years  but fuck others because your just bored or not getting what you want, doesn't mean I'll leave the good one for a good fuck. It's ALL about type. I have a type and they may not be your standard beauty or model but they know how to treat a man and how to keep one happy but that's not saying I wouldn't fuck a 10 an a min but do I want a 10 for her body or do I want a chick who I know will have my back no matter what ?   What are you after .  The coin or the throne ?

You are thirsty, not getting laid and thinking you own the bitch if you ever do get laid is why it turns you off. You know the bitch is going to cheat on you, but you think you'll find that unicorn that won't. Dude, she isn't yours, it's only your turn.

I've fucked enough wives and girlfriends to know that any bitch will cheat given opportunity and plausible deniability. These bitches like me because they know I'm not going to keep them, it's nothing more than fucking.

I know guys who like to watch their wife get fucked, it's their thing man. Not mine. I haven't cared in years if a girl I'm fucking is fucking other dudes, I get mine and she's not the only one I'm fucking. Like I said, I don't own her, she doesn't belong to me, bitches can leave any time they want, and if a sorry sap like you married one to try and keep her, she gets half your sit at least as a reward for your stupidity.

 This is reality, this is how people are, and while you wait for her to fuck you, she is out fucking someone like me then coming home and not giving you any.

> So often deadbedrooms aren't because sex isn't occurring at all, it's because it has been transferred to a different bedroom and you're being cucked!

Women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. If she's not giving it to you, she's eagerly giving it to someone else who doesn't give nearly as much of a shit about her as you do.

Hi, I'll keep this short and simple.

Since the dawn of humanity men were always in control, held all the power and women were happy because of it. But now men are forced to lose their masculinity and power or else they'll be killed/punished by other pussy men with big guns and laws who believe feminism is the right path for humanity.

Women value masculinity in a man just like men value femininity in a woman. Once you take away those values, there's nothing left to value. Why treat something with appreciation and respect if you don't value it? You don't. Thus women will continue ruining men's lives with false rape claims and draining them financially. All while bitching they're being oppressed because they've lost all masculine value and influence they used to have and are supposed to have from men.

Feminism is really a blessing in disguise because it's a wake up call for men and a hidden cry for help from women for men to regain their masculinity, integrity and control over women.ï»¿

Although the damage caused by feminism is nearly irreversible at this point, we have options, although, not easy ones. We could do a complete reform of our system concerning the values we hold in society towards women which will result in major physical conflict between the corrupted feminized men and the masculinized men who still respect the traditional relationship dynamics that causes males and females to click and work with each other properly. Or we wait until feminism evolves to the point where women start storing sperm in large containers and plan to kill or ship off all the men on the planet which will FINALLY cause men to wake up and realize this is going to be a problem for the future of humanity. Don't worry, men will deal with this problem rather quickly because they're only women. Either way, something has to change.

I always though about "changing him" this way:

* Women are women simply because they were born female.

* Men **become** men by developing themselves, otherwise they remain boys.

Because women have no concept of **how** a man becomes a man and only sees herself **being** a women because she is female, they think that some men are simply men and others are not (they remain boys). To her, it is impossible to take a boy and turn him into a man (just be yourself!), so she goes for a man and tries to tame him instead.

This is exactly what I observed in Polish girls. They seem to adore Hispanic and Italian men, dark skinned, bearded and sharp clothed men, plus Turkish men(yeap that's right) 

They do not like their Polish men because Poles are mostly born to be alphas, they want to play with betas.
And guess what? Spaniards and Italians are well known for how they look beta but act like alpha. Turkish guys are born to be betas, but the alpha ones are really good at being alpha. 

At the end of the day, both sides end the day in bedroom.

I feel like the over dramatization of beta qualities in media/pop culture is due to the fact that anyone representing these qualities is already Alpha by default. 

The actors who play the white knight lead roles, the rock stars that sing about pining for some chick... these men/characters are already very Alpha in both looks and status, so when beta BS comes from their mouths, it's seen as attractive because it balances out their already alpha state into that "mostly alpha but some beta" balance that makes women swoon. 

These men are the idols for the younger generation, who don't realize that beta game only works if you're already super alpha. Then you have a slew of teens who preach the same beta morals they see in the movies, but don't have the alpha super hero powers or good looks to back them up.

Those disses are one form of shit-tests in the particular scenario you describe.  'Shit-test' is just a broader term that could encompass a lot more than a direct insult.  It's basically anything a woman throws at you for the sake of gauging your alpha traits from your response.

A pressure-flip is a technique for passing a shit-test.  Basic example: 

- Woman you're seeing complains why you aren't paying for her (relatively low-effort shit test)

- "I thought *you* asked me out for this.  Shouldn't the one asking be the one who pays?" (flips the pressure so now she has to make the excuse not to pay)

shit tests are **NOT** a sign of disinterest. it just means a girl is still trying to figure you out. if you consistently crush all of her shit-tests in a good way, that's very attractive and will turn her on.

never getting shit-tested is actually a very bad sign because that means the girl thinks she knows exactly what type of man you are and isn't interested in learning more about you ie she thinks you're an unattractive, uninteresting beta.

No, I think a woman can "love" a beta but her love is based on what he provides for her and quite frankly how sexually satisfying he is.  If he no longer gives her these things, she no longer loves him.  Its not the loyal, til death do us part love that men and dogs are capable of.

...

I may have misjudged your beliefs, but I think you've also misjudged this subreddit. We understand love exists. But we don't think love is the end-game that should be pursued, the highest ideal to aim for, like most people today believe. Instead, most of us like to have a lot of sex, usually with multiple women. So we don't really care much about love. It's cool if women love us, but it's only optional, and same with us loving them. And when we do love a woman it's not important to show it, because doing so rarely increases the amount of sex we have, and in many cases it actually decreases the amount of sex we have. In a few cases showing your affection in a strong way can be beneficial, and some of us do that and have success with it.

I think the main difference between us here is that you want to love and be loved. I want to fuck, a LOT, and whether there is also love present or not isn't important to me. Either we have different values, or one of us is lying to ourselves about our true values.
