But...but if men can be women and women can be men...then why don’t the women that earn less just snap their fingers and claim to be men? Problem solved. Or, if men and women are the same in every single way, there IS no wage gap. Some Xer’s just make more than other Xer’s

Men are raped more frequently than women. She might want to check her stats. Also, women in prison are twice as likely to be raped by other women as men are by other men. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/us-more-men-raped-than-women

What kills me is when someone gives an example of some rich business owner that reported $10M on his tax return but didn’t pay any taxes without any understanding of how taxes actually work. If the person had to pay $11M that year for employees, equipment, overhead, etc to earn $10M then he actually lost money. How does someone pay tax on money they lost?

People act like businessmen receive a ten million dollar W2 in the mail for their 40 hour work week and  should only be able to write off their uniform.

"72% of tax reductions will go to the top x% of the top y%" is the most disingenious argument they make.

If someone is paying 1,000,000 in taxes, and they see a 1% reduction in how much they are paying. Now they're paying 990,000. 10,000 less.

Someone paying 4,000 a year in taxes that saw a 4% reduction is going to be paying 3,840 ... 160 less.

One person got a 1% reduction, the other got a 4% reduction.

"The tax cuts are all going to the wealthiest of americans"

Rubio basically wants to give moochers more money. $1100  tax credit for people that don't pay taxes isn't good enough for Rubio. A family would have to pay $2000 in taxes before they get the full credit making their tax bill effectively zero. But a family paying zero tax can still claim $1100 tax credit and get a $1100 check from the government for paying nothing. Ridiculous.

They are not liberal. They are even told what to think.
