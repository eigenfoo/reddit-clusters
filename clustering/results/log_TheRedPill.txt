But the problem with TRP is that if you try to recommend it to someone, it will likely backfire and they'll hate you for it.

All we can do is hope he follows the cycle of finding TRP:

- gets mad
- starts searching on Reddit for similar stories of men being cheated on
- reads through comments on various threads in r DeadBedrooms, r relationships, r sex etc.
- invevitably sees some comments talking about how evil TRP is
- decides to come here just to see the "misogyny" and "woman hating" for himself
- sees a couple of comments that seem outrageous but make sense at the same time
- experiences cognitive dissonance
- keeps reading TRP to find out more about what they mean
- starts noticing more comments here and there that make sense
- reads the sidebar
- some truthes start sinking in
- starts posting here

I tried being open-minded and watching this, but I just can't.

TRP to me isn't about hating women, but understanding their nature. From this I can look my girlfriend in the eyes, knowing in this moment I may mean the world to her, but simultaneously knowing that a week from now she could have another man balls deep inside her.

Am I angry? No. It's life and I accept it. TRP has allowed me to look further into things such as meditation. Now I no longer fill my head with nonsense, but love my life in the moment. 

TRP has made me more ambitious. I used to be scared to take risks, now I'm working to launch myself into the business world. Delving into online marketing with no prior experience, approaching business owners and selling myself with complete and total independence of the outcome. I'm capable of doing what I achieve if I put in the effort, don't lie to myself, and disregard any fear of rejection.

TRP is blunt, to the point, no-bullshit advice. Without TRP I'd shudder to think of the man I'd be today. While I have retracted my visits to the subreddit significantly (action &gt; reading/procrastinating), it's good to know that I can still come here to learn from men who are much wiser than myself about the realities of the world.

This report about the Hollywood-esque rendition of a "mysterious world" of TRP is mere noise. Feeding only to the vapid masses who consume, but do not create. Who take, but do not give. Who hate this "evil" world, yet do not attempt to change it.

The MRA comparison in particular is entirely wrong. The MRA goal is to change society - to pass or repeal laws, to raise awareness, etc. The TRP goal is to be happy and successful in society *as it currently exists* - to change oneself, as necessary, in order to achieve reasonable goals.

And the first step in TRP is to accurately describe society, including (actually, especially) human sexuality. In TRP, we believe that mainstream society lies to us, and it is the mistake of believing these lies that is the major cause of men's failure and unhappiness.

As an example, mainstream (read:feminist) western culture tells us that men and women are identical. You can see this lie in the advice that men get regarding attracting women. "[Treat them like people](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+"treat+them+like+people"+women)" you're told. This advice is both useless (as it's too vague to be helpful) and hilariously misguided (it assumes that men and women are identical - that just treating women as you treat anyone else will be effective). Men who follow this advice fail.

In TRP we recognize that men and women tend to be attracted to very different things. For example, we believe that women are more likely to be attracted to signals of status, confidence, etc. - and oh by the way, we have mountains of scientific evidence on our side. [Here's a source for the above claim](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1388281). 

From this knowledge (red-pill knowledge), useful advice can be derived. But mainstream society turns a blind eye to any knowledge or advice that runs counter to the feminist narrative. If you don't like TRP, then give men useful advice and give a damn about whether or not they're successful. TRP would cease to exist if you were able to do that.

&gt; only a small (but loud) subset of us support President Fuckhead.

Yeah, I for one am not happy with him as a president. I had really hoped the DNC would learn its lesson and root out the corruption which allowed them to disregard the will of democrat voters (like me) and nominate Clinton. But it appears the DNC is just doubling down on it, so, fuck em, Trump will probably get a second term.

dont blame the red pill!! blame the blue one then yourself for not understanding something you obviously still dont.  everyone on earth should know all the things RP reveals, its not a dirty secret, its the reaction to  the real secret : how easily conditioned but powerful human minds are. 
 

 Its  not the only way to "unplug" your mind and take control of your life, btw. Its not even exactly about woman.  its about reclaiming your male brain from the crippling mental conditioning that has been forced upon you since birth by a self destructive  society of egotistical monkeys.

Protect its  reputation and ensure its legacy brothers!. 
     you sir have done the opposite here with your ignorant logic and incorrect assumptions. TRP didnt kill your friend w its Harsh Truths on womans evil snakelike ways  and The catcher in the rye wasnt too popular w jocks and phonies who picked on would be serial killers. Knowledge is amoral and evolution ensures survival. grrr

 Now, TRP is the most potent after a woman has broken your heart  so give dilluted RP advice that will help then stfu.  Information is  fluid now and anyone can get to TRP reddit. if  they take the advice, it helps and  THEY ASK,  give them the actual website of your fav RP writers. Cant go wrong w rollo tomassi,s website but you must stress "start at year 1". while its still brutal he has a great way of puttin the spoonfull of sugar in somewhere to soothe the burn.
worst case they say its bs, how could u believe any of it etc. best case they unplug themselves as they alone have that power and THEN you can tell them about this forum.
   
   otherwise stick to your (growing) new found ideas and beliefs because they feel right to you, argue tooth and nail with the facts that can be proven via any source, and agree to disagree on irrelevent subjective opinions because they are meaningless.   LEAVE TRP OUT OF IT.

I haven't told you what kind of advice I've taken from either of them, though, so don't assume. There are multiple things I've gained from them that have made a good impact in my life, at times reshaped to fit me better. The reasons I've named them are mostly because they're among the few I can still put a finger on and name, I've read thousands of articles, some of which came from here (and I'm willing to consider various ideologies, including this - I just haven't delved deeply into it yet).

I'm not interested in being a slave and know I'm not one - I choose my own path and whatever advice fits with the direction I'm going at the time may be considered suitable so I can try it out and see how it works. The reason I've abandoned the idea of working a job for an employer entirely is exactly that - not wanting to be enslaved to the normal ways of people. I'll most certainly come across TRP advice too that can be applied to my journey, I just want to take all the pieces and find a way to make them work for me depending on the situation and circumstances. So now, too, TRP ideology will be explored next.

As of now, I've seen things questioning morality, something that I have also debated in my head over the years, and I've seen some experienced people give some of the exact examples I've had in my head (relating it to the animal kingdom and how it only exists in the minds of us humans), so I like to think I'm definitely not that unfamiliar with TRP ways, I'm just going to delve into it deeper now.

First off, thank you guys. This is not only a great community for the men's benefit, but even more so for the women's benefit.

Around two years ago, i finished reading all the side bar and handbook 2nd ed. It was a great eye opener and everything made sense immediately. I must say that i wasn't a beta, but i didn't have much experience with women.

I started implementing everything i learned from the handbook in real life. I immediately had results, i had multiple dates, i was much more comfortable around women. I think people are afraid of the things they don't understand. But i knew women now and i knew the things they want, the things even they don't know they want.

After some dates, kisses and a few one night stands, i found a promising girl for a relationship. I must say after you read the handbook you get the feeling that women are evil. But it's a misconception. Women are evolved that way and you must understand them that way, then you get over that feeling.

In the beginning, there were some problems, especially because she was a kind of alpha in her circle. But i was very strict about the rules of TRP. Soon she accepted my authority. I made it clear that i was the dominant one and i would find another girl very easily if i wanted. 

I now realize the most important thing i did right, was being emotionally unresponsive. Women are already very emotional and you have to be -at least look like- emotionally stable. 
Whenever she cried about something stupid, or had some problem about her family, i was rock solid, i didn't cry with her, i told her that those were not that important problems, she shouldn't worry too much at max.

Whenever she had some stupid problem with me that i am not aware of, and she didn't talk with me, i just ignored her. Soon she realized -now she confesses- that we were to start talking again anyway and it was stupid for her to do this for two days. She started to talk with me directly anytime she had a problem with me.

Also very important, you should never, ever step back while she starts crying. It doesn't change anything. It's not only trp, it's my character, when she pulls a face and didn't talk with me, i asked myself these questions.

- did i get caught fucking other women? no.
- do we have a place for living? yes.
- do we have enough food and water for living? yes.
- do we have jobs and enough money? yes.

then she has some stupid problem and she will get over it. and sure she did. i never asked her, please my love tell me what's your problem. please ...

Now she says she cannot live one day without me, she tells all the time how much she loves me, how much she's lucky to have me etc. I can give her any order and she will happily do it. She prepares dinner, i have sex whenever i want, she serves well when i have a guest, she never bitches about anything.

Btw, i don't tell the same things, like you are my life bla bla. Mostly i just smile or kiss her when she says it. She knows i am not emotional and she doesn't expect the same words from me.

Again thank you TRP for everything..

UPDATE:
When i started this thread, i thought it would be deleted (there is a warning) but i wrote it anyway because i sincerely wanted to thank TRP. I didn't expect such good comments, thanks for that.

There are people who are more fanatic than the founders of TRP and take everything literally. I believe you should embrace TRP not decide everything in your life according to a book like bigots.

&gt; If you're explaining to Billy the concepts of sexual strategy, text game, and frame, but he knows you haven't been laid in 6 months, then he's going to nod his head politely and write off any advice you give.

..it really depends WHO this person is and how well you know them, and how much you care about them and their future.

Case in point - it took me about 3/4 months to convince my brother that his BP bullshit was drying up all his opportunities. I gave him The Rational Male when I left the country and he actually read it! Told me he wished he'd read it years ago and how eye-opening it was, and he'd not read a book in years. I'll likely check on him from time to time in case of regression, but I think he's now on the right track.

I would also persist like this with very very close friends if I thought they were receptive to change. My brother was quite stubborn, but he'd not been laid in a long time and I was clearly having a lot of fun plating women. I think that probably helped to convince him of the legitimacy of my advice and TRP mindset.

If you don't really care about this person or their mentality or their future.. sure.. don't persist in helping them in face of their stubbornness. But if you DO care about this person, then at least put up a good fight against their doomed BP ways before you throw in the towel.

I've also had lots of casual conversations about TRP with plenty of people who have been receptive (read: know the person you're talking to) by steering the conversation if they started talking about women. I didn't necessarily have those conversations to impart advice.. I just explored some of the concepts, and suggested some reading material or whatever if they seemed interested. A couple of guys got back to me (one a co-worker at the time) who had gone off and spent the night reading Rational Male blog. I understand some people are unwilling to change and not interested in anything that might affect the security of their beliefs, but there is a serious problem if you're surrounded by people like that.

I'm starting to think people suggest you don't talk about TRP because they don't want any competition haha my experience of speaking about TRP with mature, intelligent men (whether BP or not) is nothing like what is described here.

Because we enjoy learning from people's real experiences too. This whole thing only works if there's enough people actually going out and learning from the real world. Otherwise the entire community generates TRP ideas from their own imagination and their own hamster, and then as a result, all the stories and ideas traded around are pointless. 

I don't really care what people do. But if you're going to want to be a contributor on TRP and if you're going to claim to be some level of knowledgable or alpha or successful, my belief is that you need to actually have results in your life to back that up. 

I am not upset or aggressive, you're reading into it what you want to see. You ask why not hand out information and let people decide? That's fine, that is what most of us do. The problem is when the people handing out the information don't know wtf they are talking about, and they are just disseminating information that is almost right because they've memorized what to say. This leads to wrong ideas - or at least ideas not reflected by the reality of sexual strategy - entering TRP's current consensus. 

Does that make sense? We don't care what people do with TRP. But we do care if they are blatantly out of touch with reality / haven't learned anything themselves, and they come on here spouting off BS.

**A little Note**:*About 3 years ago* i Found TRP and cant even remember how i stumbled upon here but well is the best thing that could happen to a young men however it could also be the WORST THING FOR A WEAK MINDED INDIVIDUAL.like someone here once said &gt;"you don't find TRP,It finds you". With that been said once i discover this sub i been applying what i read and continue to improve myself here and there even tho to be honest i still get a bit angry at Female Nature but Im getting to a point where  from the bottom of my heart im Accepting it for what it is ,God made women and he decided what nature to give them,God made snakes and also decided what nature to give them.I'm Finally making peace with this Reality.

**NOW THE REAL STORY**:*INTRODUCING TRP TO ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS*:

during the time i found TRP i went to a bar in a small town with one of my best friends whom i had not seen for a long time.we had awesome conversations,talked about life,remembered the good old times ,girls we fucked etc.once we got into deeper stuff about life and how things get harder once you reach adulthood we got into the topic of how hard dating becomes,and i had no hesitation to talk about redpill experiences with him and drop some knowledge,i also asked him if he heard about TRP and  he had no idea about it so i told him what it was 
and how its the only HARSH TRUTH about Female Nature.once i told him about it i saw how his physical well being changed as if he seen a ghost,he started  to tell me experiences with women and how "things make sense now" he said *all the women i have dated were all the same not one was different than the other* and i told him about AW-ALT and that he is not alone, neither i had dated a different women even if they acted sweet at first their true nature will be revealed inevitably.

**THE MISTAKE I MADE**:

Something I Forgot About Was That This Guy Suffered From Depression In The Past to the point of cutting himself!. Unfortunately he was WEAK MINDED!About 1.5 years later i received a text from a mutual friend of us giving me the devastating news that he had committed suicide!!that really HURT ME  This guy was just a great person and one of the best friends i ever had.i felt like TRP discovery got him into depression  

**LESSONS LEARNED**:

*Be careful who you show TRP to

*This is an individual JOURNEY

*Only advice others But dont Show them TRP if Necessary



**TO SUMMARIZE** :*I introduced TRP to one of my best friends and  he is Now DEAD*

I’ve never commented on TRP before, but there’s been a few posts in recent weeks which have almost caused me to do so. The one user who had a great Alpha v Beta v Sigma v Omega analysis/comparison I found very interesting. This is finally the straw that broke the camels back. 

There’s a lot of vitriol directed towards TRP currently. I’m not certain of the exact reason, I could hazard a few guesses, but I’ll not bore anyone with my conjecture. I was reading the post on the banning of Incel and everyone’s really whooping it up over there. It was until I started seeing comments comparing TRP to Incels, that I felt it necessary to speak. There’s a giant echo chamber of misinformation and falsehoods happing. It’s literally an emotional rollercoaster with each person saying I feel this way or I feel that way, without any basis in reality or experience with what they speak of. Basically anyone who doesn’t buy a ticket to their dog and pony show, can just fuck right the hell off. 

Instead of doing some research and trying to understand other points of view, there’s a lynch mob forming, pitchforks, torches, bad teeth and all. I’ll not deliberately antagonize the mob into killing TRP, but I’ll also not stand idly by and watch something worthwhile be destroyed to sate their desire for more blood. 

I’m not red pilled currently, nor is it likely that I’ll ever truly be. I digest the knowledge, accepting what works for me in my current life, discarding what does not. I’ll not pretend to be something I’m not in order for acceptance. I’m just an old school pickup guy, who was introduced to that stuff the year after college, as I had to figure out how to get laid in the real world. I wandered in here because of the obvious parallels in this community to my own quest for knowledge. This place is different than Incel. It’s not even comparable. Yes, certain things that are discussed here, can be off putting and even I can have trouble digesting those ideas/terms. However, TRP (to me) is about self-improvement. Hell yeah, there’s tough love (crap gets called crap pretty quick around here, too quick sometimes maybe, but whatever), but there’s also compassion and a profound level of respect for intelligent conversation. Everyone’s here for a reason, the more experienced among us having gone through exactly what drove the newer people here in the first place. TRP doesn’t advocate those horrid Incel ideas or defeatism. TRP motivates. TRP is about success, not failure (even failing 1000 times can lead to 1 great victory). TRP is about quality, quality posts, quality comments, quality discussion. TRP is full of people doing exactly the same thing I am, working hard on improving. There’s no blame on women here, merely a look in the mirror, objective analyzation of the situation, recalibration, making of another attempt, trying a different tactic, and ultimately triumphing over adversity. 

It would be sad to have TRP die, as this is a good place for discussion and growth. Let’s think on this, if TRP pisses this many people off, we must be doing something right.  However, I’m not overly concerned, if death happens we will meet again in other dusty corners of the internet friends. We will continue to go in search of knowledge and we will gather again once we find it. People like us always do.

I'd agree with you if this actually was exploring the nature of women but it really isn't. The best way to do that is to go out and meet women and get to know them. Also all I've seen so far is assuming and bitching about women, not getting to know them. Also, spoiler alert, women aren't that mysterious! Just other people!

11636
It's not that they can't, nor are people against women in the workplace here, but it's literally forced upon every girl and woman to "go out and work" even if they would rather just be happy at home. Look at it this way: if society pushed women to stay in the kitchen, that'd be bad right? It inhibits the women who want to go out and work. 

6992
Perhaps. Or perhaps I just come from the manosphere 10 years ago when WIMP is defined "Women-Influenced Male Person".

Look at both TRP or MRP. How many men are improving themselves so they can be attractive to women? How many men are doing X or Y so they can be attractive to women? How many male people here are influenced by women?

Spend your time however you like, but make sure you're doing it for yourself, not for women or being "manly" to women. That's all I was saying 

17923
This sub just helps men bring women down from the pedestals on which men themselves have placed women. If anything, this sub makes us view women as humans rather than the Princesses or Goddesses we used to make them out to be.

And no one's 'taking advantage' of women. We work on ourselves, make ourselves attractive and women who find us attractive have sex with us. I really don't see the 'taking advantage' part of it.

12099
&gt;  Because women attack and shame that which goes against their gynocentric best interests, and they ignore the facts while doing so.
&gt;
&gt; Not committing to women? Not marrying them? Having casual sex? Not providing for women? SEXIST!

For example, women will whine incessantly about how supposedly unjust marriage is to women - but if you were to suggest that men should (say) erect billboards ordering men to stop oppressing women with marriage, women would lose their shit.

I was saying to this woman I know that few women in the US wear perfume or makeup or or go out of their way to be attractive. She was like "we don't need to." She's right, and I think we'll know that the dynamic is changing when more women try to be attractive. I didn't make a play for this woman. Just told her about the smokeshow European women I date. The ones that wear perfume.

Honestly, all of this gender divergence, while yes it could be attributed to feminine drive toward power, men eventually will win this fight in the long-run. 

Women aren't good at acting unselfish, they're supremely more selfish then men. Men will take a bullet for another person, the president, their family, will willingly go to war and put their life on the line for a country that doesn't care about them. Women are not wired to be unselfish. In the long-run, women will tear each other down in this "feminized" world they're creating because fewer and fewer non-religious women will be getting married, and the ones that don't get married but perceive themselves to still have high social value will envy and detest the ones who do get to have everything ie. "the great job, the great marriage, the family". 

Today, in 2017, let's be honest, the women who rise to the top are the most cunning of them all, but once they get to the top, they have very little interest in more women being their competition. They played the game in a man's world and won, powerful women actually have a huge interest in preventing more women from rising up going forward because they have a harder time competing against other women. 

Women are highly distrustful of other women, they're incredibly sexually competitive more so than men and that will spread throughout the country, this sexual competitiveness. Its especially true when you consider that white women, who dominate the feminist arguments now and ignore all women's issues in the rest of America, are insanely selfish about their version of feminism vs. Black women or Latino women. 

Asian-American feminists (ones with Asian descent not foreigners) I've seen categorize themselves as "women of color", that stupid girl who did the #firecolbert BS few years back, she actually called herself a "woman of color". Really? She believes  the same fucking experience as a black woman in America? That's absolutely insane, and 
Black women resent white women to the extreme, but also resent anyone trying to think they have it as bad as they do. 

Black women are the ones who can tear down feminism in America as it stands today because they actually are the ones who have real world problems, not fake made up ones that most white woman claim to have. Single black women are the cohort that struggles to find a partner to the most. In the long-run they'll reject intersectionality as its driven by white women at the highest class, and realize that they have everything to gain in America by tapping into a widely available pool of white men who white women have totally rejected.  Same goes for Latino women too. 

And this hasn't even touched on the backwards acceptance by white "feminists" of Islamic women who are subjected to religious rules that aren't aligned to sexual freedom and female power. Islamic women have already bought into an anti-feminist worldview by wearing a Hijab, they're essentially saying they know their place up against men. What happens when white women, as white women will do, start going after Islamic women for wearing Hijabs? 

Ultimately, there are many ways in which this feminized world just gets torn apart from the inside. Media cares about news that drives clicks and attention, Facebook too. Media is what drives #metoo, and it only has staying power as long as it makes money. If people get tired of another #metoo campaign, it won't go viral, and it won't be talked about.

I found this to be true, there are many lesbians that will get along better with men in generally then women. They may well have partners as well, but working with women or dating new women. Oh god, what a nightmare. 
I also have meet quite a few straight women that open hate working with other women because of all the drama.

Not all women are the same, some are annoyed as well by the self absorb nature of many modern women.

Theres no need to believe this women friend is lying. man, some of you guys are paranoid.

&gt;Women care about women, men care about women.

What? The only ones that despise women more than anything are other women. Women generally do things that benefits them , not for the sake of benefiting all women, people are selfish overall.

Also how easily women break of BFF statuses, talk shit behind their "besties" back, spill the secrets.

I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER fucking work under &amp; for a woman. EVER..........

Personally I've never been attracted to black girls. I've thought about it for a while, and honestly the only black girl I would ever have sex with is Nicki Minaj hahaha, so essentially race is very important to me because it seems to correlate with my preferences. 

This is my hierarchy: Asian girls = white girls &gt; light skinned Latino's &gt; brown girls &gt;&gt;&gt; black girls. 

I've always assumed most men would be like me and have essentially no attraction to black girls and the majority of brown girls, but perhaps I'm alone in this.

**Introduction**

I see a lot of posts on askTRP of butthurt dudes wanting to get back at girls who have done them wrong. These are mostly guys who have just discovered this page and have just reached the anger phase. I usually advocate against trying to get any sort of pay back as its just petty and makes you look like a child. However, I think this one I'll make an exception to.

*Just want to cover this before the rest of this as I know it will come up. I wasn't dating the cheater. We were just getting to know each other but what she did was pretty scummy. Enjoy.*

**Body 1: Girl 1**

This story starts just like most do on this sub reddit. Boy meets girl (girl1) : I met this cutie in my class at school (college) and hit her up outside of class one day (protip: don't game girls in your actual classes cause if shit gets weird you'll regret it). We start talking and chemistry is good so I tell her to meet me for coffee the following night.

Long story short we go on 2 dates with shit logistics so I can't pull back to my place. She messages me about a "party" she is throwing one night and I was chilling with my buddy so we decide to go (even though this fucked me in the end idc I still say yes to every social invite). We get there and it's literally her and like 7 friends that look like they've never seen the outside of a high school band room. Safe to say we weren't staying long.

Everything is going good until I tell her to pour my friend a drink. She starts  talking to him and discovers "OMG HE HAS TATTOOS" and she is instantly following him like a puppy dog. He asks her if she has any tattoos and she actually says, "I have one that I got because my ex told me he'd break up with me if I got a tattoo." I immediately wrote her off (know how to spot crazy guys). We end up leaving and my buddy and I are laughing the whole way home about how ridiculous this girl is.

She ends up inviting him to do the same thing her and I did a few nights before and made sure to send me snaps of it. I laughed and deleted her right away (cut contact with these crazies). He texted me saying she was flirting with him hard core so I told him to fuck her and that I didn't care (don't ball hog if you can't score. Let your bro take a shot if hes open).

Long story short he pumps and dumps her because she's shit in bed and crazy. Even tried to pregnancy scare him. Glad I didn't pipe.

**Body 2: Girl 2**

Her friend (we'll call girl 2) who was at the party and is also her best friend sends me a random message every week or so following that. I ignore them and eventually she gets the hint idc about either one of them. Girl 1 tries to reach out to me after a few weeks when she realizes she just got alpha widowed by my friend. Of course I leave her on read.

Then one day I'm swiping through the good old watering hole known as tinder when I match with Girl 2. I forget who she is at first and she messages me first and I just game her like normal. She ask if I remember her and says we know each other. I play it off like I don't and reply with, "You're the girl with the cute turtle tattoo right?" (shows I fuck with other girls: abundance). She explains who she is and I pretty much ignore her.

She messages me later that night that she is lost downtown and needs a super hero to come save her (I tell girls I'm a superhero when they ask about my work). I tell her I'm off for the night but send her my address and tell her to join me for a movie. This is where things get interesting.

She gets to my place and messages me that girl 1 followed her there (oh yeah she just so happened to follow you. bullshit). I tell girl 2, "cool, tell her to follow you home." as I legitimately want nothing to do with girl 1. Tells me girl 1 justs wants to say hi and then she'll leave.

I go outside and greet girl 2 and ignore girl 1. Girl 1 says she doesn't want me to be mad at her, wants to be friends, etc. I just say, "no thanks I don't need more friends." We go inside door and girl 1 follows. I look at her in silence like shes an idiot for about 5 seconds and give her the *begone with you peasant* motion with my hand and say nothing. She leaves and I continue like she was never there.

We sit down, start watching Pocahonas 2 (I love disney movies fuck with me bitch). *sidenote disney movies are great for switching to fucking. If you are netflix and chilling pick a disney movie or something boring so she will want to do....other things.*
Literally flip her over start making out with her and the rest is history. Got zero LMR and fucked the life out of her.

**Lessons Learned / Closing**

I'm not really sure what new things I learned here that already were not ingrained in red pill. The main things that made this happen is that this girl already thought I was cute (gave me eyes before when I met her), ignoring her like I didn't give a damn, and going straight for logistics. I don't advocate going out of your way to do this but if the opportunity arises go for it because it's definitely a great feeling. I'll walk in class tomorrow and give girl 1 the biggest shit eating grin I can. Hope this gave some of you guys a laugh. -Dad

Sure thing man.

18 almost 19, UK(North West), No beard, black. Moderately attractive, just as fair as everybody else here. 

The thing is though, I'm incredibly nerdy. I'm saying this so people don't get the impression that I'm one of those big muscular black guys who get girls easily. I hit the gym but I'm fairly slim. Not huge arms or anything, just near moderate. Used to wear glasses but swapped them out for contacts. Don't have a hairstyle, just plain.

Now for the approach, I'd like to add that I'm not counting saying quick remarks to girls. Only full approaches.
Stats:
Approached Successfully - 15 girls. 
Rejected - 4
Approached me - 5

Anybody can get rejected so it doesn't mean a single thing. For instance, I spoke to a lot of girls studying mundane shit that I didn't care about yet they were all attractive and into me. I meet these two girls, bantering back and forth, I become interested in one and she tells me that she's studying something in literature. Now I'm attracted to women who are actually smart and not just basic. The conversation seems to be going super well but then the girl says that she needs to go to the toilet. They go off, I assume they left the club but later I see them standing. I come and talk to the girl again for a bit, ask her if she has snapchat. She starts to look around trying to find an answer. At this point I realise what's happening when she said she doesn't have it. I smirk and tell her that she's lying but in a playful way and go elsewhere. 

I honestly can't explain my mindset that night. Usually rejection would be an issue but I was treating it like I was playing a video game. This game doesn't work? Move on to the next. 
The hilarious thing was that that same girl was one of the most unattractive girls physically I met that night yet she rejected me. Hell come to think of it, I was only rejected by girls who were roughly 6s or less. At the start of the night when we started approaching, I tried talking to two girls and they simply waved me away.

Rejection just means nothing man.

Now for the friends thing, as much as I hate to say it, they didn't approach at all. There was just something up with their moods that night, even they explained it. These guys are casual approachers and do it often but that night they were acting a little beta. I did all the approaches and sometimes they would try to join my set.

When I approached the eight girls, as soon as I was hooking them in the conversation, one of my friends comes and sits down. The girls completely ignore him so he leaves. 

Inside the club, that same friend wants me to come and approach with him. I specifically said as a joke but half serious. "Can you keep up with my energy?"
The reason I said this is because you both need to be on the same level of emotional state. He was feeling a little down and not so talkative whereas I was jumping into every situation. 

We agree to go together so I tell him to find a girl. He points at a purple haired girl in the distance who he thinks is absolutely gorgeous. I simply smile and then go up to her with him.
(As I write this I'm starting to realise how good that really was. I didn't even think about it, just walked up straight to her.)
The girl is with another girl and one guy. I notice that the guy had long white hair and a white coat, basically dressed like a rockstar so that is my point of interaction. 
I go to the girls with my friend and immediately open the guy by telling him he has an awesome jacket. Whilst that happens, my friend comes in and tries to talk to one of the girls. I can't remember what happened because it was all so quick but the purple haired girl starts bantering with me and I explain to her that my friend thinks she's attractive. We both start laughing together. At this point, the rockstar guy had walked off.
Both girls fall hooked into a conversation with me whilst my friend tries to join back in but can't.

He then accused me of AMOGing afterwards. 

Point is, I did all my approaches alone.  Actually, I remember telling the french girls that I was in the club by myself. They absolutely loved me for it. I'd never go to a club by myself though, it's different. 

Hope this helps mate!

With first question, eye contact is quite important for cold approaching or getting girls interested in to you, or test the waters and see if they are interested in to you or not. You can improve it by making eye contact with strangers outside, for example I used to have really poor eye contact, I would usually turn away when someone looked back at me.. then I decided to improve it.

And when it got stronger I realised how powerful it is.. like one example of how you can do it.. try to get the moment when girl will notice you, look at her and when she looks at you smile, or just check her out..


If she is interested in to you she will check you out later, and that way you will know that she is in in to you, also you will have some sort of contact and approaching will be easier..

Few times it happened with me like you see it in movies.. like one time I was socialising with my friends at the pub, and there was another group of people, I noticed one girl looking at me so I made sure she noticed that I checked her out as well, and we basically looked at each other few more times over time, then I went to a bar to get a round and she went to buy something as well, we just looked at each other and smiled, I already knew that she is interested, so we had some more eye contact, and later I decided to test the waters and showed her a pack of cigarettes and looked at her like if she wants to go and smoke one, she nodded and I went outside so did she.. we chatted, but then her friends came out and few girls were jealous of her or something and they were luring her back in and shit, and one girl started calling everyone to go to a different place and did all kinds of things to disrupt us..

Tl;dr I got her number, we went on few dates later and banged and also dated for few months




And for second question, look wise of course, personality wise might not be yet..

Because you wouldn’t experience certain things yet and wouldn’t know how to react.. e.g eye contact, tone of voice, knowing what you can and can’t say to certain girls. Jokes girls like, how to move to another step e.g approaching, escalating to a kiss, getting her home and banging..

Also it depends on your goals, like if you look for girls to date or one night stands..


But I guess it also depends on where you live.. e.g I lived in Russia/Baltic states for most of my life, girls there have same mentality and basically they have the idea that a guy should chase a girl and prove that he is the one before she even kisses him - so from that you can extract two points 


* for long term relationship this is good because if you get a girl like that she prolly won’t be a slot and will be at some point loyal to you, but it will be harder to get her and you will need more effort/patience and take methodical approach and not escalate things too fast..


* another point, as a short term hookup perspective this is harder, because she will have “anti slut” mindset and escalating things too fast might ruin it.. so your game will need to be strong  at all levels for that.



But as I said it is different in different parts of the world.. like I have friends living in Germany and some of them are in to dating girls regularly, and it seems like getting a girl to your home on a first date is nothing major, they don’t really mind and often come on a first date..


Like in Russia, 9/10 girls will never go to your place on a first date..



But one tip I can give for personality, just don’t take things seriously and put a bit of selfishness when it comes to dating..


Like when you see a hot girl, don’t be afraid to check her out, even if she notices it.


Don’t be afraid to talk and joke with random girls, or initiate small talks..


Like I usually say some dumb shit and troll girls, and they instantly know that I don’t care and they kinda like it, they like to laugh and many girls like guys with laid back mentality

&gt; Because why would he chase one option and make it so hard for himself when he can choose from multiple other options

I fuck many girls but they are not the same for me. There are always one that's better than the other. I have a "tits" girl. An "ass" girl and also a "Can bring to a party" girl.

I think he might be right. 

Fatherless girls will probably be better for a sexual relationships since they seek a "daddy" and an alpha Chad will provide that. These girls probably won't be loyal long term though compared to girls with fathers.

Basically, fatherless girls make better sluts. Girls with fathers make better girlfriends.

Out of all the things that didn't happen, this one didn't happened the most.

The story:

* Girl was in relationship
* Girl though she could do better and wanted to get the slut out of her system
* Girl got all the dick she ever wanted and more
* Girl found out she couldn't do better (can fuck 'em, but can't quite make 'em stay)
* Girl used her awesome pussy power to get her ATM back
* Girl made up a lovely story about what was the *"real"* reason for leaving him
* And she lived happily ever after

In my experience, there are girls who have substance and are flexible, and there are those who don't. Some girls can be charmed by your personality. Others can only be charmed by your looks and social value. Both can be charmed by looks and social value, but only one of them can be turned in the other direction. This is a fact, in my book.  It's up to you to decide which ones you want and do whatever you need to do to get there. The reality is that 90% of the girls who are all about social value and looks aren't very interesting people. I need someone i can talk to about shit that i like. People with substance, from whom i can even learn something. That doesn't happen with those types of girls. They have nothing to say. On the other hand, you do find girls that will look at something unusual and feel intrigued by it. Girls who love to talk. Girls who are deep. Girls who are smart. Girls that aren't looking to be IG superstars Those exist. Their profiles tell me everything i need to know about whether or not they're worth the effort. 

I don't quite understand this obsession with the social value thing. I mean...yeah, that helps a lot, but it isn't a prerequisite to get girls. I'm not a very social person and the girls i nail know that. They still wanna talk to me and be with me. The most important thing is simply them enjoying what they receive for you. Whether is your attention, the things you say, the way you make them feel when they're next to you. There are many, many, many factors that people around here often ignore, and i suspect that's why you miss so many great opportunities. You're looking only in one direction, assuming there's only one way and girls are all the same and want the same exact thing. That's factually false.

Exactly this. This one time ihad posted pictures with a girl had been fucking at the time and all of a sudden out of no where all these girls I️ had interest in started hitting me up and replying to my messages.  Girls want what they can’t have/ what other girls have. The picture made it seem like I️ was unattainable and some girls can’t take that. It’s the same old theory that when you have a steady girlfriend out of no where every girl wants to get with you all of a sudden

All of my spontaneous threesomes have started with me being out with a girl I've hooked up with or am about to, and meeting up with an acquaintance or girl that's shown some signals, NOT a romantic interest. It needs to be a girl in town for the weekend, a friend of a friend, etc. 

Get the two girls talking by way of a gentlemanly introduction, and play up the first girl's hotness. "This is my friend Ashley, she's a former model" or whatever.

Then take first girl home and text second girl saying you're going back for a night cap and to swing by. Nothing else. 

Second girl shows up. She'll immediately talk to first girl because women are social pros. Let it go from there. If you need to encourage a bit, tell both girls they're hot and ask if they've ever dated other girls. Don't start making out with one and isolate the other.

Damn, I trying not to laugh out loud at your drivel because my slut is on a conference call with her job.

To put it simply, you know fuck all. You found a so called unicorn and assume you know everything now. 4 years an incel and now you want to espouse your ideals to everyone else. Oh yes you know massive amounts about relationships, because you have a vast expertise based on experience. What. The. Fuck. Typical fucking kid.

I know I was the first inside my second wife. I popped out and yes it was obvious because I've fucked hundreds of sluts. Every time after that first one was like the others. She had none of your orange and red flag bullshit. Zero. I talked to her for five months before I popped her cherry, pushed her often to find out how she reacted to various things. After my first wife I knew exactly what to look for and what I did not want. So I tried to do what you're doing and vetted her ruthlessly.

She was 1500 miles away, I was active duty, we met through a mutual friend, so it took a while for me to get leave to go fuck her. Virgin, good family, takes care of her body, seriously all the good shit. She was all the good stuff and none of the bad. 

7 years in we hit a small bump, but worked it out and got married just after 8 years. 16 months later we were divorced and she did everything wrong that the first one did, plus more. I've dated well over 200 girls from all over the world, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the States. From girls who grew up with wealthy families to those who grew up poor as fuck. Virgins to outright whores.

Get this through you're fucking heads. AWALT. Every fucking one of them is very capable of doing the same stupid shit, and blaming you for it. You can't be alpha enough to keep her, because what she wants changes all the fucking time. All you can do is not show weakness, never kiss her ass, always lead, and know that eventually she will go stupid and fuck things up.

I've been fucking this slut for 3 years now, she is in awe at me in every way. Mind blowing sex, an intellect that continues to astound and challenge her, heliosphere sized confidence, and she knows beyond any doubt that I can pull girls half my age with ease. I know it's all fleeting, it can end tonight on a whim. No problem with me, I'll replace her in less than a week when it happens. I live my life exactly how I write in here, and everyone who knows me in real life would tell you I say exactly the same shit all the time. She fucking loves the way I am. I'll enjoy it and fuck her as often as I can write it lasts, and not concern myself with the end at all, because I've already accepted it will happen.

This chick is purportedly low n count, very feminine, cooks for me, takes care of me when we're together, and craves getting fucked by me. Long distance, single mom, minority, and over 40... But she knows how difficult it is to find a man like me. That means she appreciates me, but I am under no illusions that if someone better comes along that bored her hair back, or if I drop in value of some sort, she's gone. She's welcome to go, I do not own her, I enjoy my time with her for as long as it's enjoyable. She isn't mine, it's only my turn, and in my case it's her turn as well.

The second point is happily ever after does not exist. Get that until death do is part religious bullshit out of your head, all it will do is fuck you up. Live by the morals you choose, and let it go when it's over. You know the adage make hay while the sun's shining? Yah I fuck them as much as possible while I can. If they're hot enough I take lots of pictures too...myriad reasons for the pics, but lots of them when she's one of the hotter girls. 

Relationships have a life span like everything else. Understand that. You do not own her, she does not own you. If she is nuts or something, next. This isn't a lifetime tv show, it's not a fairy tale, it's fucking reality. AWALT. Know it.

You know what man? Maybe you sister is just too judgmental? I mean, fuck micromanaging every thing we say to them. Fuck that.. seeking their approval like their pussy is gold made. Too much emojis? Damn i had complains that i’m too cold.. so when you’re cold it’s bad and when you warm it’s bad. Fuck this shit! Any girl has some kind of judgmental map in her head through which she filter guys and it differs according to her level of judging. You can never really know what to do exactly. 

I don’t mean that fuck game and do what ever you want but on the other side, ain’t rollo tomassi said that doing whatever the fuck you like IT is real alpha??  Maybe she just wrong about the dude?.. then it’s her fucking loss.. 

My theory is that if he would just wait for her to say something goofy about him and if he would say “well, fuck you then” then she would change her mind about him instantly.

When woman say " your not my type" that doesn't mean they won't fuck you , it just means they won't stick around to keep fucking you and they have someone who they see themselves with long term and not short.

I know his from experience and because I've done this to woman.  You can fuck one and still not be interested or you can have one good one to stick with for years  but fuck others because your just bored or not getting what you want, doesn't mean I'll leave the good one for a good fuck. It's ALL about type. I have a type and they may not be your standard beauty or model but they know how to treat a man and how to keep one happy but that's not saying I wouldn't fuck a 10 an a min but do I want a 10 for her body or do I want a chick who I know will have my back no matter what ?   What are you after .  The coin or the throne ?

Be who you are and accept it. It’s pretty fucking simple man. The confusion comes from society’s expectations. Fuck that. 

You wanna split a bitch in half, fucking go for it. You wanna rail out some dude, fucking go for it. You want some dude to bang you senseless, fucking go for it. You don’t have to pick only one of those choices. 

Being congruent in yourself is the first step to happiness. That’s not some motivational fb meme. You do you man, fuck it.

I wouldn't doxx myself like an idiot on fucking redpill, *bitch*. 

It took you 3 years to supposedly fuck a 19 year old, how long until you fuck a woman who's reached their prime at 21-25, *bitch*?

Get. The. Fuck. Out. Of. Here. NOW. 

No one wants to hear this bullshit about your yellow fever, faggot.

Peace out, "brah".

&gt; No woman will fuck a HB3.

Dead wrong. Dead fucking wrong.

&gt; He has to work his ass off, gym, career etc, for years.

So some women will fuck an HB3.

&gt; Wrong. Guys up to HB6 will be ok fucking a HB3,

That's really not what we are talking about. We aren't talking about ugly people fucking ugly people. All ugly people can fuck other ugly people. We are talking about ugly people fucking good looking people.

&gt; Elen Musk is a fucking rockstar, HB fucking 10.

HB scale is just looks and nothing else. It's not charisma, it's not people skills, it's not your nice car, it's not your wealth, etc. It is just how you look to people who nothing about you other than how you look. You are confusing SMV with HB scale.

&gt; You are deluding yourself. Most men are thirsty as fuck and would fuck goats.

I would never fuck anyone who was lower than an 8 and they would need to have a great personality if they were an 8.

&gt; Plenty of men I know marry 200+ lbs blobs.

Yea, because those guys are also low on the scale. We are not talking about ugly fucking ugly. We are talking about HB3s fucking above their weight by a lot.

You are thirsty, not getting laid and thinking you own the bitch if you ever do get laid is why it turns you off. You know the bitch is going to cheat on you, but you think you'll find that unicorn that won't. Dude, she isn't yours, it's only your turn.

I've fucked enough wives and girlfriends to know that any bitch will cheat given opportunity and plausible deniability. These bitches like me because they know I'm not going to keep them, it's nothing more than fucking.

I know guys who like to watch their wife get fucked, it's their thing man. Not mine. I haven't cared in years if a girl I'm fucking is fucking other dudes, I get mine and she's not the only one I'm fucking. Like I said, I don't own her, she doesn't belong to me, bitches can leave any time they want, and if a sorry sap like you married one to try and keep her, she gets half your sit at least as a reward for your stupidity.

 This is reality, this is how people are, and while you wait for her to fuck you, she is out fucking someone like me then coming home and not giving you any.

1330
&gt; So often deadbedrooms aren't because sex isn't occurring at all, it's because it has been transferred to a different bedroom and you're being cucked!

Women will fuck. They may not fuck you, they may not fuck me, but they will fuck someone. If she's not giving it to you, she's eagerly giving it to someone else who doesn't give nearly as much of a shit about her as you do.

16454
Ha!

I threw that one in there at the end just to point out, it doesn't fucking matter that you fucked the girl, what did you learn.

There's millions of women, fucking her isn't special. If you're smirking about why she's a bitch to 99% and you fucked her, then a part of you *knows* why she fucked you, you've got it going on so I guess that last part allows you to bask in the glory of the pussy you fucked.

4360
I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER fucking work under &amp; for a woman. EVER..........

I think you guys are just not his friend. The way you talk about this Henry guy is dumb as fuck. Seems like a cool dude, he didn’t get mad when she starts flirting with that Steve guy. This was probably an eye opener for him as he sees she is a slut. 

Maybe spend more time on your own dealings? Rather than trying to decide how “bluepill” some other guy is?

[Mark Regnerus says, “My central claim in this book](https://www.amazon.com/Cheap-Sex-Transformation-Marriage-Monogamy/dp/0190673613) is that cheap sex is plentiful—that it’s flooding the market in sex and relationships—and that this has had profound influence on how American men and women relate to each other.” Yeah, he’s right, for the very top guys. Top 20% probably. The other guys are playing videogames and bitching on the Internet. Game is so important because the top guys are getting the sex. If you don’t learn game and you’re not a natural, all the other guys are going to be getting laid and you’re going to be whining instead of learning. It must be dispiriting to be the average guy reading about all the sex other guys are having and not having it himself. The average guy is too lazy to turn his frustration into action,  so he keeps sitting on the couch, while the guys who use frustration to propel themselves into action start getting laid.

The book is based around the myth that there’s this sexual cornucopia out there for guys. There is, yeah, and I’ve had it. I’ve had it in general and I’ve had it [through the swinger and open-relationship worlds](https://theredquest.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/sex-clubs-swingers-and-game/). But access isn’t free and it isn’t that easy for the vast majority of guys. If it were the game world wouldn’t be blowing up like it is.

Most women are unsatisfied too, because guys have left their masculine identities behind. I used to think women were just lying whiners, but now that I’ve learned enough game to evaluate guys the way women do, I see their point. Sleeping with a fat or skinny fat video game player who is unemployed or underemployed can’t be much fun for most women, even women who are themselves fat or skinny fat. Women are unsatisfied because guys are unsatisfying. Learning game makes women happier too. They want to be seduced but most men are too inept to bother learning how to do it.

Guys who aren’t red pill and getting laid are going to get angry reading the book. One Regnerus interviewee, Sarah, says, “I meet people in strange places. . . . It just happens.” From her perspective I bet she’s being honest, but she means that she takes zero responsibility for her decisions and she also only responds to what men offer her. Only the boldest and most game-trained men open a lot of strangers, so she’s naturally selecting for guys who are in it for sex. Kinda stupid if you think about it, right? But she doesn’t, or doesn’t critically, kind of like how fat guys playing video games wonder why they get no tail.

Individual responsibility is the basis of achievement. Sarah gets around to fucking “David, a musician who seemed more committed to making it in the industry than to making it work with her” (2) No shit. Musicians don’t want long-term relationships, and music is an almost purely mating call signal with little long-term economic viability. Guys who do music are specializing in casual sex. And I recommend that guys work to specialize in casual sex (e.g. hit the gym, [don’t eat sugar](https://theredquest.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/zero-sugar-will-change-your-body-and-life/), learn game) rather than civilization-building (get a job, maximize income via long work hours, etc.). Guys need some minimum viable amount of money, but the rest is game.

Regnerus also cites a precursor book, Anthony Giddens’s The Transformation of Intimacy, and in that book Giddens predicts how the

&gt; achievement of reciprocal sexual pleasure [becomes] a key element in whether the relationship is sustained or dissolved. The cultivation of sexual skills, the capability of giving and experiencing sexual satisfaction, on the part of both sexes, [has] become organizad reflexively via a multitude of sources of sexual information, advice and training.

Couldn’t agree more. Guys need to develop sexual skills. Women would rather be with an exciting deadbeat who gets them off than a boring office guy who doesn’t. If she keeps getting off she’ll keep coming back. She wants to be taken to a sex shop, pick out some toys, and then have you use them on her. The first time a woman gets off with a plug in the back and a man in her front, she often thinks she’s seen God. Doesn’t matter that it’s a physiological illusion. You want her to think you’re Jesus. Cultivate your sexual skills. Great lovers are made much more than they’re born.

Regnerus says, “Opportunistic men are pressing women to operate more like men by privileging the physical over all other traits, and women—to mate at all—feel like they must play along.” He means, “women, to mate with the highest-value men, feel like they must play along.” Plus, a lot of women bring zero skills to their relationships. I’ve met a million slovenly women with no cooking skills who literally bring no concrete skills to the relationship apart from sex. If all they bring is sex, then yeah, guys are going to evaluate them on looks.

I’ve literally had this conversation with exes who bring up the ultimatum: move in or I’m moving on. And when I say I won’t live with a woman, they want to know why, and I ask, “What skills do you bring to this relationship?” They’re confused and then I point out to them that I’m a better cook, I make more money than they do, and I have better mechanical skills than they do. So what are they going to do to make my life and our household better? What gains from trade are we going to reap?

Then they start crying and I feel bad about making them cry.

We break up anyway.

Women won’t stay in uncommitted relationships for more than two years. Usually much shorter than that. Personally I’m happy to make them my official girlfriend as long as they’re willing to do swinging and non-monogamy, which, as I’ve said before, are underrated for top 20% RP guys.

Women want guys who make more money than they do, but if you’re a guy who makes more money you are also putting a lot of it at risk: “Women are far more likely to want out of their marriages than men. Among divorcees, 55 percent of women said they wanted their marriages to end more than their spouses, while only 29 percent of men reported the same.” So there’s a paradox: guys who want to marry often can’t because women won’t take their broke selves, while guys who don’t want to marry because they have too much to lose are often most sought by women.

Don’t get married. I’ve said it a million times before and will keep saying it till guys wise up.

There is much more to this book than I’ve written here and I recommend it to all guys who want a better view of what’s happening. Regnerus doesn’t go all the way RP but he’s damned close.

GARBAGE but here it is because it will be deleted (following is the original post):

Know some things about me before you read my post: First of all, I’m not male so there’s only one other thing I could be. Secondly, you and all of your plates/exs would look like 3’s compared to me. Yes, you should feel bad that most ppl look terrible. About 90% of women are low value/underaverage/average (average is just a nice way of saying ugly). It’s not my fault the world values beauty over everything else. Society was set up that way before I was born.

Like the title says - Do guys get increasingly insecure the longer they go without sex? Bc girls don’t. Girls can’t even fathom what it’s like to be insecure without sex.

The question is: is it possible for guys to be secure without sex?

I’m sure if you surveyed all of the sluts/porn stars/prostitutes in the world asking them if they got insecure without sex, 99% of them would say “no”. They also wouldn’t know that guys got insecure without sex bc ppl only care about themselves.

That’s too deep of a topic for girls to entertain, guys getting insecure without sex. They also just wouldn’t care about what guys wanted.

Girls just know that guys WANT sex. And they like taking advantage of it to manipulate/enslave guys. They don’t care that guys get insecure without sex.

So, is it possible for guys to be secure without sex? Bc they should try to achieve that. Guys shouldn’t want to have anything to do with women for as long as they are manipulative. Going after women is the least productive thing guys could possibly be doing right now. It’s like feeding into a black hole.

TL; DR Guys shouldn’t trust women with their security bc they are selfish/manipulative/malicious/retarded

I’m expecting a lot of dumb comments so just know a few things about female nature before you want to dismiss my post because you feel threatened by how true it is: (1) you were manipulated to obsess over sex so that women could take advantage of you (2) girls obsess over how to manipulate guys (3) girls get their ego from manipulating guys &amp; they don’t want to give that up (4) girls don’t get physically attached. They don’t even know what that is. That’s like some alien concept to them (5) most of trp ideology is wrong bc it revolves around their rigid belief that girls are highly sexual (6) it’s hilarious, if you let guys come up with truths about women/the world, they will oversex the entire thing

^ I posted this once before and it got taken down by a mod who’s jealous of me for being smarter than him or something, I don’t know. Could you leave it up this time even if it gets 5000 downvotes? This post is more important than any other post on this subreddit. This post should be made into an announcement &amp; it should be put in the sidebar.

Here is some more information so that you don’t get confused and say something stupid in the comments like what happened the last time I posted:

Why did I identify as female in my post? Bc the other times I posted, everyone thought I was a guy and talked to me like I was a guy. I wanted to clear things up.

Don’t tell me females need male attention to feel secure. Attention and sex are different. Girls don't get insecure without sex.

All the guys browsing/posting on this subreddit get insecure without sex. TRP wouldn’t exist if all men were secure without sex.

Trp taught you the wrong things about male-female dynamics. Girls don't categorize guys into AF/BB. Seriously, who came up with that concept? That’s the dumbest thing I have ever heard in my life.

Yes, girls are VERY insecure, but they don’t get insecure without sex.

This is something very important for all guys to know and internalize:The only reason girls come back for more sex is to make sure guys put their full effort into validating them and doing as they like, which is taking advantage of guys and essentially emasculating them. Girls don’t feel validated from the physical act of sex itself, they know that guys are desperate for sex so they come back for more sex thinking they can use it to get other things that they actually want out of guys. Yes, all of your ex-gfs did this to you, all of your past hookups did this to you, and all of your future hookups will be doing this to you. Society was set up this way for women to have this particular advantage over men.

I already know you guys are going to comment something really ignorant so here is a tip for you on how to be a realistic person: if guys saw women as putting money/resources/emotional support as their number one priority and saw them as not having a genuine drive to desire guys physically, then they would have a much more accurate view of women.

Don’t bring up some experience of yours to prove some girls legitimately want sex, it doesn’t change the fact that their initial reason for coming back for more sex was to get other things out of you. Girls can't keep up with how sexual guys are on a biological level (the frequency and variety they want sex) so they would only tolerate it to get other things out of guys. Guys were manipulated by society to have high sex drives specifically so women could enslave them. Guys can't build healthy relationships with women because women (and society) are the problem. Women are the darkest beings to ever walk the earth.

Don’t tell me to post in AskTRP, this subreddit gets more traffic so that’s why I posted here.

&gt; Do you want to be the guy that approaches 100 women and gets a lay out of it

How about this?  Be the guy that approaches 200 people a day and find friends, business contacts, new hobbies, artists, lost relatives, a new plumber, the guy that gives you a deal on rugs, a city council man to help you with your development proposal, all sorts of other things and occasionally pussy.

Be THAT GUY.  The guy that talks to everyone.  It will get you more sex and more everything than this nonsense.

10292
Wow that's pretty interesting. I'd imagine they don't have many guys in their life seeing if they'd be a fit for the guy - i.e. I'm sure every guy is just hoping she thinks the guy is a good fit. I've tried to implement that style in my relationships now -&gt; seeing myself as the prize and testing her to see if she is a good fit for me.

Very attractive quality for a guy to have.

I do not agree at all that it is easy for women. Yes, they can have their pick..are you aware how many losers, fat guys, stinky guys, guys with shitty personalities, guys without higyene, man bitches, guys with emotional health of 16 yo, insecure guys, guys who need validation...and so on..she have to deal with? 

It is almost extremely hard for a woman to find suitable men, and I would even argue, we have it better - what matter to us is 90 how her ass looks like, we will work around the rest.

Go to any club and see who approaches girls - usually desperate "come on" guys without any charm and value whatsoever.

Decent, by decent mean ok looking guy with job and emotional maturity of a man, who is also packing some charm, is rare as fucking diamond today.

They have abundance of dicks, which is far from enough for women. Now men also have access to easy pussy (through whores or prostitutes) and it is honestly equally bed.

1072
Here is a fundamental rule about women all men need to understand. 

Women generally only have eyes for ONE guy. You either are that guy, or you aren't. If you are not, nothing you do or say matters - leave. 

Women that have several guys on rotation are either doing it because either: 

1) none of those guys are the ONE, so she keeps a team so she can get a little of what she wants from each guy: one guy for companionship, one for sex, one for money, etc... or 

2) The ONE will fuck her but won't commit, so she gets commitment, companionship, etc... from the other guys.

I guess it is possible for a woman to be in a relationship with the ONE and cheat anyway because she's just so fucked up, but I don't think I've ever seen it.  

If you are not her ONE, leave. You may want to "demote to plate" but even that will be a pain in the ass because she will flake, only do shit when she feels like it, hang out with other guys, etc... 

1534
I'm talking about the beta males - the nice guys who can't be saved. The guys with brains are going MGTOW subconsciously - and there is heaps of guys who have above average SMV and who do lift - but aren't no where near chad - these are the guys who are backlashing. 

7670
These women prey on lonely guys they can use.  The guys who promote the single moms have no other options, so when she pushes him, it's either go back to a life of no sex, or give in.

Which is why she goes for such desperate guys in the first place.  She knows that guy will never find anyone else, and that's exactly who she was looking for.  If she wants a good looking guy, the complete opposite of the guy she "dates", she can do him on the side.  She won't push for a relationship with him because he, in contrast to the guy she's "dating", can find someone else.

21666
Yeah. I responded to that fool. It really is as simple as:   
If she’s talking about another guy, to another guy, texting another guy, etc., she’s thinking about said guy. 

If she’s thinking of him, it’s because she’s thinking about what she’s going to do to/with him, or thinking about what she’s just done to/with him. 

Get her mind; get her body.

Hi, I'll keep this short and simple.


Since the dawn of humanity men were always in control, held all the power and women were happy because of it. But now men are forced to lose their masculinity and power or else they'll be killed/punished by other pussy men with big guns and laws who believe feminism is the right path for humanity.


Women value masculinity in a man just like men value femininity in a woman. Once you take away those values, there's nothing left to value. Why treat something with appreciation and respect if you don't value it? You don't. Thus women will continue ruining men's lives with false rape claims and draining them financially. All while bitching they're being oppressed because they've lost all masculine value and influence they used to have and are supposed to have from men.


Feminism is really a blessing in disguise because it's a wake up call for men and a hidden cry for help from women for men to regain their masculinity, integrity and control over women.﻿


Although the damage caused by feminism is nearly irreversible at this point, we have options, although, not easy ones. We could do a complete reform of our system concerning the values we hold in society towards women which will result in major physical conflict between the corrupted feminized men and the masculinized men who still respect the traditional relationship dynamics that causes males and females to click and work with each other properly. Or we wait until feminism evolves to the point where women start storing sperm in large containers and plan to kill or ship off all the men on the planet which will FINALLY cause men to wake up and realize this is going to be a problem for the future of humanity. Don't worry, men will deal with this problem rather quickly because they're only women. Either way, something has to change.

Yeah the full story is kinda long but I can give it to you if you want to.

The context is something like that I know a lot of girls are interested in me and have reached player status.
I was setting girls up against each other with dread game.

*men, they will never get it* was meant as shaming towards me for not bending to her and being her little bitch.
men, they will never get it: "Omg, you asshole I'm so jealous right now"

EDIT: also look at the specific use of the word "men" women used to not call me a man, a beta turd is not a man.
You can't be a man if you don't get it.

&gt; competition, giving, and protecting

Da fuq? You're defining what is it to be a 'good man', as Jack Donovan puts it. There is a difference between a 'good man' and a man 'good at being a man'. Do you feel the difference? 

The guy who is a 'good man' is cucked, and values feminine traits. The man who is 'good at being a man' is amoral and is precisely what the OP suggests.

&gt;misogyny, slut shaming

Fuck off with your white knight, cucked bullshit.

&gt; Men get murdered more, men die younger, etc

Usually at the hands of other men.

What the vast majority of women fail to grasp is that all of this, society and their position, was put into place by men.  Men enforce the state of affairs.  At some point, there won't be enough men under their tents to enforce their prerogatives...  and that's when things get interesting.

Enjoy the decline.

This was disgusting to read. You sound like the quintessential meat head male. And you make men look bad.

Men certainly take pride in what they do, but it has nothing to do with being male. It has to do with the social programming that tells men that we are supposed to bring home the bacon, even in a world where that isn't true. 

Acting like it is some demanded act given in our DNA does nothing but perpetuate the idea that men are only men if they fit some preconceived idea of what a man is.

Women aren't  raised like men, they have no sense of honour. Npo sense of higher life or death virtue that we as men have drilled into us from when we were toddlers.


Men are taught we should lay down our lives for our loved ones or our belief in what is right. We have films and media idolising that and always showing the hero sacrificing for his greater good or his family or a woman (I think dying for a woman is bluepilled now).


Women aren't taught any of that from the ground up like small stuff "respect a mans handshake", **"don't kick a man while he's down"** none of this stuff they write off as "toxic masculinity" and scoff at is absorbed by them. It actually makes them severely lacking in character. 

There's so much as lads we are taught. What are they taught? Find a man to die for you, you can convince a man to fight your battles for you. Don't worry you don't have to take responsibility for anything. 
Women don't have any honour like we do.


That's why you are right. You cannot make a deal with a woman like you can with a man.. 

I mean one of the Matt Lauer accusers just came out and said "It was totally consensual" but still said she was "traumatised".

Women are so emotional and hysterical and just having a current trend can make a woman destroy your life or join in a flock of women harming men or a specific man because of "feels".

It's actually incredible. And I bolded **"don't kick a man while he is down"** and this should instantly click with any man reading this. Think of the absolute psychopathic levels of pain a woman will inflict on a man without thinking twice and even convincing herself that the man is at fault and was "always abusive" and "I never loved you" and think of the common sense of honour most men have and the feeling of "not kicking a man while he's down" women just don't operate like that.

It explains so much.

Note: This is a blog I posted on my personal website yesterday. So it's copy/pasted but not plagiarized. This is a rant I had to get off my chest after reading one too many man hating posts on Medium.com. 

Somehow, over the past 15 years, radical feminism became mainstream feminism. Now, gender studies professors in every state are teaching girls they live in a patriarchy designed by men to oppress women. All women are victims, and all men are evil. Masculinity is toxic, and sex is rape. Every week, I see new tweets, blog posts, articles, and Youtube videos of women seething with fear and disgust at the entire male population.


I feel ridiculous stating the obvious, but since feminists are doing such a successful job of making it trendy to hate men, I feel obligated to stand up for us. If you hate men, you’re ignoring at least 13 obvious facts about life:
 

**1: You can’t generalize half the world’s population.**
 

Negatively stereotyping and every member of any group for the actions of its outliers is the definition of bigotry. The bigger the group, the more illogical it is to generalize the whole. Misandrists lump half the world’s population into one negative caricature! It’s so obviously insane, I don’t know how to elaborate on it.

 
**2: You’ve met good men, a lot of them.**

 
I can think of more than ten males who have physically, emotionally, or professionally bullied me. You probably can too, but we can also list women who have hurt us and men who have loved and helped us. Every day, you walk past dozens of men on the street, work next to men, give orders to male customer service workers, and listen to male reporters, politicians, celebrities, and educators. You interact with men every day without flinching because you know they’re not a threat. Chances are, there’s at least one man you call on holidays to say, “I love you.” If you can find exceptions to the statement, “All men are evil,” then you shouldn’t say it.

 
**3: You know women who will vouch for the men in their lives.**
 

Most women are looking for a man to fall in love with, and most will find one. If you think all men are evil, then either you, or most women, have a factually incorrect perception of reality. If most of the women in the world disagree with you, then you should question your objectivity. Chances are, the problem isn’t that everyone else is closed-minded; you are.

 
**4: At least half of all men are beta.**


If you think all men are monsters involved in a global conspiracy to oppress women, you must never been to a Star Wars convention, comic convention, LARPing event, chess club, choir club, Weird Al Yankovic concert, or dating website. Most men younger than thirty, have a panic attack just thinking about talking to women. Those men end get friend-zoned, exploited, pushed around, and discarded by women who know beta males will put up with it just for the privilege of being near a woman. You’re ignoring evidence that contradicts your conclusion, if you believe there aren’t at least 1 billion gold diggers around the world, manipulating beta males and spending their money. Every year, millions of incel, forever-alone, beta men kill themselves after losing all hope of ever being able to control their fate, find love, or succeed in a career.

 
Picture of Wyatt and Garret, the nerdy main characters from the movie, "Weird Science."
If this is who you believe is oppressing you, you’re projecting.
 

**5: At least half of all men are wage slaves earning less than the cost of living.**

 
If you listen to feminist propaganda about how ruthlessly men have designed and gamed the system to give them every advantage in life over women, you’d think all men live in an easy wonderland, where they sleep on beds of gold and lay around all day while women in chains feed them grapes. In the real world, grapes, and every other fruit and vegetable you buy at the grocery store, are picked mostly by male wage slaves who work long hours for less than a living wage. They get minimal breaks, no employee benefits, and their bodies are in constant pain. This is just the agriculture industry. In every sector of the economy, men do the most physically painful jobs that make life easier for everyone else.

That face you make when you work at a job you hate all day, every day, don’t get benefits, and earn less than a living wage. Then hordes of feminists accuse you of oppressing 4 billion people.
 

**6: There’s a line of men who would eat a mile of your shit for the privilege of licking your ass hole.**
 

I served in the U.S. Air Force for seven years. I heard women complain how they have to work twice as hard to make it in a man’s military, but on a daily basis, I saw men lining up to do women’s work for them, help them after work, and hold them less accountable for bad behavior. I knew a woman who would put ice on her nipples every morning to make them pop through her shirt to ensure men would desire and serve her. Any woman, regardless of body type, can find men who want to worship and serve them. Even feminists who hate men, still have fanboys orbiting them and telling them everything they want to hear. Everywhere you look, there’s evidence men worship women. The only way to not see it is to lock yourself in a confined space where only angry women are allowed to enter.

 
**7: Women have some systemic privileges over men.**
 

It’s a well-documented fact that the American legal system gives women lower sentences for the same crimes as men and gives women preferential treatment in divorce and custody cases. Women can send a man to prison for rape, even if he has evidence sex was consensual, but it’s almost impossible for a man to send a woman to prison for raping him.

Physical fitness requirements for women in the military are lower than for men. Women aren’t required to register for the draft. Women have more options for domestic violence support, student loans, small business loans, fellowships, and jobs at companies with affirmative action policies. You have to ignore billions of dollars of government spending to hold onto the belief that the system has abandoned women and given men every advantage in life.
 

**8: Women spend more money than men.**
 

Even if women get paid less than men for the same work, women still spend more money than men. If women were as oppressed as feminists say they are, then 4/5th of the stores in malls would sell power tools, work boots, and flannel shirts. In reality, 2/3rds of the stores in malls sell women’s clothing made by in Asian sweatshops by male and female slaves. In every first world country, women spend more money than men. Every marketer knows, women are the engine of the global economy.

If women make so much less than men, the only way it’s mathematically possible for them to buy as much as they do, is by spending their man’s money. It’s ungrateful and abusive to accuse men of being complicit in a global conspiracy to rob women, while most women spend men’s money daily.


**9: Women die with more money than men.** 
 

Despite the unendurable stress of being oppressed, women live longer. So regardless of the wage gap, married men spend most of the lives sharing ownership of all their assets with their wives, and in the end, women get it all. That’s not oppression. That’s winning. If the system is designed to set anyone up anyone to fail, it’s men.
 

**9: Men work at spas, where most customers are women.**

 
There are hundreds of thousands of day spas, massage clinics, pedicure clinics, manicure clinics, waxing clinics, esthetician clinics, and other business dedicated to pampering women. Most of the people who work in these leisure industries are women, but there are men who spend every day massaging, manicuring, pedicuring, grooming, and pampering women of all colors, who are often spending their man’s money. If you don’t understand why people don’t take radical feminist seriously, try protesting against male oppression in the lobby of a luxury day spa and see how foolish you feel afterward.

 
**10: Men built and maintain the infrastructure that keeps you from living in a cave.**
 

Radical feminism teaches a revisionist version of history in the world was built on the backs of women. It doesn’t include how many men died building railroads, bridges, skyscrapers, sewers, dams, or roads. It doesn’t mention the countless hours men labored in fields, factories, mines, boats, and forests. It doesn’t honor the firemen, trashmen, cooks, movers, industrial cleaners, or mechanics who have worked until their hands bled and kept working. Maybe if women did more of the backbreaking work men take for granted, they would realize how green the grass is on their side of the fenc.e
 

**11: Never forget your soldiers and what they sacrificed for you.**


Nobody in a foxhole ever said men have it easier than women. You don’t need to go to war to understand that. If you can watch any war movie, and still look a veteran in the eye and tell them they never had to sacrifice anything, and the world would be better off without them, then the problem is you’re pathologically self-centered.
 

**12: Everyone is good and evil.**

 
Everyone loves and hates someone. Everyone has helped and hurt someone. Everyone wants to do what’s right, but nobody knows how to be perfect. We all make mistakes, because everyone is born, lives, and dies ignorant. No individual is completely good or evil, let alone any group. If you only acknowledge the worst things done by the worst people in any group, you could justify being bigoted against anyone, but that’s insane.
  

**13: The root of the world’s problems is predatory capitalism.**

 
If it seems like women and minorities are oppressed, it’s not because white men designed the world to oppress them. It’s because rich people designed the world to oppress the poor. If it seems like most rich people are white men, it’s because you’re only looking at white men. In every country, the majority of people are poor, and the majority of rich people have the same skin color as the majority of the population. And behind every rich man, is at least one woman spending his money while he works.

You’re not being oppressed by the white boy who takes your order at McDonald’s. He’s being oppressed by his employer, who is also oppressing you by selling gullible customers addictive, overpriced poison burgers. Aborting all the white babies in the world won’t change the normalcy of predatory business practices, and neither will lynching the rich. The only thing that will accomplish the goals of feminism is economic reform. As long as feminists continue directing conversations and energy towards hating men, business owners of every race will continue to exploit everyone unopposed.

&gt; All this is easy to understand if you realise that men are active and women are passive/reactive. (Yin and yang, really.) Men are givers, women are takers. (This is not "good" or "bad", it's just a fact based in evolution and biology.)

Women give too. 

&gt; Men build civilizations, and I mean literally. It's men who go out there and build roads and houses. It's men who actually do the real work. 

Women have done those things and more and most men do not/have not built civilizations. 

&gt; Feminists love that women now outnumber men in the US workforce

Shouldn't you love that too? Don't you want women to do *real* work like men?

&gt; but 90% of women's jobs are either beurocratic or some kind of customer service, so in reality women in these jobs do not CREATE anything, they just leech off of the jobs that produce wealth. 

OK? Most men don't create jobs either and leech off of other men. Think of minority men in different countries that leech off of "whitey's"? Welfare, affirmative action, section 8 housing, etc, are used by men too. 

&gt; So, what I'm getting at is men need motivation to channel their energies into building things. And there exists only one thing in the whole wide world which can motivate enough men to work together: having their own families. 

So no families means men don't work? Interesting. I've heard that when men divorce their wives, they stop seeing their children because men want to be family men. I think that's stupid but whatev's. 

&gt; No amount of shaming or monetary rewards can motivate enough men to voluntarily slave their lives away in soul-crushing jobs.

Is that why there are more homeless men than women?

&gt; We are at a stage where the government is actually forcing men to work (child support, alimony, etc), but all those with eyes open know that this is SLAVERY and will not work in the long term.

Not slavery. You're getting paid. And taking responsibility for the children you father. 

&gt; Feminism strips men of their families, thus strips them of their motivation to build civilization.

Again, you accuse women of not taking responsibility while not taking responsibility yourself. 

&gt; And rest assured, if men begin to "slack" in vast numbers, women will NOT grab the shovel and do the dirty work. This is why matriarchal civilizations collapse. If men are not interested in it, they will disengage and let it rot away. 

Women work. Women are garbage collectors, technicians, engineers, lawyers, police officers, architects and are in other valuable positions. 

The problem is that those areas are predominantly male and women are constantly harassed by them. 

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/20/3-psychologists-explain-why-men-harass-women-in-the-workplace.html

"Shawn Burn, Ph.D., is a psychology professor at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis. She says "sometimes, sexual harassment is used to intimidate, disempower, and discourage women in traditionally male-dominated occupations."

I always though about "changing him" this way:

* Women are women simply because they were born female.

* Men **become** men by developing themselves, otherwise they remain boys.

Because women have no concept of **how** a man becomes a man and only sees herself **being** a women because she is female, they think that some men are simply men and others are not (they remain boys). To her, it is impossible to take a boy and turn him into a man (just be yourself!), so she goes for a man and tries to tame him instead.

11109
When were all those men born? Not in the early 90's or 2000's that's for sure. It's a whole different world between the men of then and the men of now. The men of then were just starting to be subjected to an increase of feminism. The men now are receiving it full force.

Literally single article I read criticizing the red pill is based entirely on straw man arguments.  


Why do they always interview "ex red pillers" (aka guys who used to be purple pillers then became blue pullers again),  Why don't they ever interview actual red pillers?  

Her conclusion demonstrates her fundamental misunderstanding of TRP:

&gt;Every man on the Red Pill has a different story. However, each of them do have striking similarities. The main one is anger. Like the name of the subreddit itself, it is blazing red. 

There's a reason we call it the anger phase, because swallowing the pill it's just part of the 5 stages of grief.  When you hit acceptance is when you are truly free and have fully digested the pill.

The red pill is not for everybody.  We need betas in order to keep our society functioning.  Naturally some men will reject the red pill because they were destined to be betas from cradle to grave.  That's just the way it is.  That's the only way you can go from purple back to blue.

5573
I have been lurking on red pill since 3 years but stayed a beta, never accepting the truth about women. I was stuck in a bubble. Recently, after applying some red pill tips I got a girl and she did what women do to all betas! It literally OPENED my eyes to the truth of the red pill. Dumped her yesterday and swallowed the red pill! 

I have read half of The Rational Male, re read the red pill sidebar and posts on game, frame etc. 

This psychological bubble where we men are made to believe that women supposedly are innocent and all is shit! Including the feminism.

Yikes, hopefully hes okay. I now understand the dilemma of my message and how i can share it with my fellow red pillers better, perhaps my approach was too straight forward. I think that actually your 100% right, that FIRST you need to wad through the bullshit and "negativity". I think the step/red pill im proposing is more of an advanced step once you've properly figured out the basics and don't have your head up your own ass if that makes sense. And yea now I see that perhaps this was the wrong subreddit or atleast the wrong APPROACH to this subreddit, since it is indeed sexual strategy based. And just one final thing, I do agree you cannot go back to blue pill once you swallowed the red pill. But the thing is, is there's red pills inside the red pill, there's a matrix inside the matrix, and it keeps going deeper and deeper until your enlightened. What I'm talking about here is exactly this concept. This red pill im reffering to, or as you perceive it as "blue pill", is saying that someone with an abundance IDGAF mentality doesn't even see the words Alpha and Beta, he (or she for that matter) just exists in the way that makes them happiest and truly content with reality at the highest level. Does that make sense?

You're wrong.
Its NOT about You or Her.
Its about the Kids.


When you can TRANSCEND YOURSELF, you've Graduated from the Red Pill.

There are no colors there - no red, no blue, no purple.

You see things as they truly are - without the filters of Ego/Self First ("Red" pill) or Self-Last/She First ("Blue Pill).

You're not Color Blind any more.

YOU CAN SEE!!

&gt;Why does Blue Pill society hate The Red Pill

Because "Blue Pill" society is dependent upon people conforming to the blue pill agenda: *"Women Good!  Men Bad!  Just be yourself! 
 Wage Gap!  Muh FEELS!"*  The very *EXISTENCE* of the Red Pill is a direct challenge to the lies upon which the Blue Pill Agenda is based.  

Blue pill society needs betas who are just smart enough to run the machines, pay their taxes and not ask questions.  Anything that disrupts that is a threat.

Not sure why it’s being downvotes either. Some guys on here will act like they’ve been red pilled since they were born, but almost all American boys are force fed blue pills from an early age. It’s not easy swallowing the red pill in its entirety, and many of us have probably experienced a situation in which we opened up too much and let ourselves deviate from the red pill path.

I've read alot of Field Reports here on the Red Pill and one thing alot of them have in common is "my friends are all blue pill."

Why not feed them the Red Pill? My circle consists of 6 guys. I was the one that discovered the Red Pill and now whenever we get together to smoke weed (420blazeitfgt) I usually bring up the Red Pill. Its been going great! They all swallow it very easily because of  a few simple reasons:

1. Deep down every man knows the Red Pill is true. You just need another man to talk to you about it and put it into perspective.

2. They trust me. I've known them all since Elementary School. These are my bois. If life decided to shit on me today I'd be fine because I know they got my back and they know I have theirs. That reason alone is enough for them to trust me when I talk about the Red Pill.

Now they read the Red Pill. Now they are constantly mind blown by Red Pill thinking. We're not Beta bois either btw. We have all lost our virginity, we have all had multiple girlfriends, and we have all lived with a woman before (even the 19 year old lmfao he was victim of some serious roasting sessions because of it) so by no means are we some beta bois who can't get bitches. We're just regular men with beta tendencies because society programs you that way.

The main problem was that we blamed ourselves for a lot of woman behaviors. What the Red Pill is doing for us is helping us know that sometimes it's not us. Society has conditioned men to feel guilty whenever a break up happens. Even if the man did nothing wrong he will feel guilty because he "failed" his woman. The woman can be batshit crazy but a man will blame himself for not being able to control her batshit behavior. 

Now my friends are slowly all becoming Alphas. Now when we go out our chances of picking up girls is stronger because we all know Red Pill thinking. We can quickly identify which woman wants to get with which guy and that makes it easy and clears confusion. Nobody gets jealous because we understand what is going on. There is no blue boi in the squad to get all in his feelings because the girl he wanted wants someone else from the squad. 

I've hung out with a group that had a blue boi before. They call "dibs" on a woman and when that woman shows attraction to someone else in the group the blue boi gets sad and eventually becomes angry and that can sometimes ruin a good night. I've personally had my night ruined by a blue friend before who went into depression after girls kept refusing to dance with him. He caused a scene in the club, which prompted me to have to save him and get him out of there. He walked up to a couch full of women and just laid down there, all drunk, and fell asleep. They were creeped out I could see it from across the club. I went to go wake him up to remove him from that situation and when I went to move him he quickly sat up and headbutted my nose with his forehead. I was fucking pissed, that shit hurt and my nose got swollen I had to leave the club or risk looking like fucking Pinocchio except with a fatass nose.

So instead of going out with your blue friends why not turn them Red? Maybe not all of them, but at least your closest boys. Get them into the Red Pill and do them a favor! If they really refuse it then oh well, at least you tried. Don't be that guy that swallows the Red Pill and then refuses to give it to their friends out of fear they will out-alpha him or just because having blue bois around you makes you look better.

If the whole squad is Red Pilling it will only make the whole squad even better. Alphas get better by being around other Alphas. Herds of fertile females will begin to flock around the pack. If everyone is Red Pilling than every pantie will be moist. No female will feel left out because there is an Alpha buffet in front of them. 

Every group of girls has that one girl that takes care of them. The one that doesn't get as drunk and keeps her senses in order to take care of the group. She can't cockblock the squad if she's busy taking pipe from your boy lol.

In conclusion, because I am typing too much, share the Red Pill! The world needs REAL men now. Bring awareness to your blue friends and if they dont accept it ditch them. I have blue friends who I am still friends with but I dont really hang out with them. 

Example: Blue friend is obese, takes dabs all day, plays video games all day, and is in depression constantly because all the girls hes nice to dont fuck him lmao. I try to Red Pill him but he thinks hes the most intelligent man alive so I gave up, oh well I tried. Now he just blames "the system" for his "oppression" lmao. He will bitch about woman on social media and I tell him "You need some pussy bro" and he responds "I dont even care about the sex I just want a faithful female blah blah" and my response is "Suuuuuuuuuuuuuure buddy". You cant tell me its not a pussy problem when you're still a virgin at 24 years old. 

Share the Red Pill guys, do men a favor! You sacrificed alot of time for the wrong bitch before why not sacrifice a little time to help a friend lol

#What is upstream red pill? 

So are these guys people who advocate for spirutally uplifting sluts and saving them from whoring themselves out?

They claim to be better than the red pill - how so?

Why do Red Pill super stars support some upstream people?

For example - Gay Lube oil and IllimitableMan both support some guy named AJA Cortez on twitter, but AJA Cortez actively bashes, criticizes, and hates the red pill - he calls rollo a bitch. So why do GLO and IllimitableMan support that guy if he hates the red pill?

Are GLO and ILLM just shills for upstream red pill?

What is upstream red pill? 

3675
Well thats why men are either blue pilled or enraged red pills and then later somewhat calmer red pills. 

Blue pill is a male projection of what he needs onto reality. enraged red pill is when you are smart enough to realize its a mirage and you feel like youve been lied to about the mirage. Calm red pill is when you are getting your dick sucked.

Im not sure I could tolerate getting my dick sucked with my current understanding of women. Its the uncanny valley for me. Do you know what that is?

You are wrong, sir.

The purpose of marriage has nothing to do with the relationship between the man and woman. Marriage was designed to raise healthy, capable children. Fathers must be present in a child's life for this to happen. When men are having multiple sexual partners, it decreases the chance they will stick around for their kids. Single mothers become rife. 

In other words, the west was built upon the family unit of a married man and woman with children. The more marriage declines, the more society declines. 

3931
If you got into a long term relationship with someone who already had children and you raised those kids for 18 years, they would still be your kids in your mind. Biologically no but he was still the only father they ever really knew. To those children and how their lives were impacted, their real dad was nothing but a sperm donor.

19816
It has. Too many people were using it as a source of bribes for too many years.

Rich people could ignore it anyway by paying extra money for each child. 

And sneaky people were ignoring it by having unregistered children - who would then grow up legally unable to marry, get a family book, have their own children, buy a house etc.

I'm an Australian married to a Chinese woman, living in China. They came to our house and tried to insist my wife sign a form saying she would have no more children after the first child. I laughed and told them to go away because foreigners could have as many children as they liked. After some argument they left. We never heard about it again. A few years after that and after some horrendous cases of forced abortion that were televised the government canceled it.

19089
You probably already paying child support. You haven't married before right? Good keep it that way. From what you say, I'd say you had a good life why? No marriage. Having children however is probably the biggest mistake you made because you probably have to send child support. Never marry to the grave.

12230
&gt; Women are not loyal to men, they're loyal to themselves &amp; to their children.

Given that - which I agree with - do you think children and women's love for her children change he hypergamy especially if the father (who let's say she's married to) is a legit father/provider/etc.  

I think it's understated here how some women don't want to jeopardize that.  They see their friends that are divorced and even though she got the money, kids are miserable (not in all cases but many - sorry divorce is hard on kids - period).

5364
I mean having control over you or just being able to keeping it moving. I’m not well versed with child custody and child support laws, but I’m thinking if you eventually want to have a kid, whoever you pick to be the mum even if she’s the most loving mother possible, shit can change with time and she can use your kid to fuck over w/o marriage.

14634
Haha so true. She actually suckered a guy into marrying her and adopting the first kid. Few months later she divorced him and now has the dumbass paying her child support for a kid that’s not even biologically his. That’s what the white knight life will get you. Meanwhile the first kids Dad has no clue the kid exists. And we’re talking about a kid that’s 11.

16142
honestly - the legally safest way is to knock one up (same woman for multiple kids), but still live separate.  Pay the child support, do the weekend visits, etc.  Build it to more often as the kid gets older, be involved with the kid, be a father to the kid.  But realize that authority wise, you'll always play second fiddle to mom, until/unless the kid(s) choose your wisdom over her dumbass-ness.  

That way you get to be a father, have relationships with your kids, build legacies, etc. - and their mom never gets the rights to everything you have.  Kids are expensive, you're gonna pay out the nose for them no matter what.  At least with child support, it's a known number and you can plan for it, and their mom can't just go take more from the bank account as your wife.  It sucks, but it also puts a cap, even if onerously high, that she can't go beyond.

17341
Here you go...it's called "paternity by estoppel."

Single Mothers (SM) can get a court order to force a man to pay child support for non-biological children and is the MAIN REASON to avoid entanglements with SMs at all costs. This is referenced in legal circles as "paternity by estoppel."

It’s the "new thing" that judges/courts are enforcing across the United States. It's summed up as "if at any point a man performs duties and activities as stepfather, he can be forced (by court order) to pay child support to non-biological children that he DID NOT produce." This is done in the "best interests of the child/children." The courts have zero concern for men who are NOT the bio-dad. 

I tell this to young men all the time, many who are clueless on this trend - that their hard-earned money will cover expenses for children they had no hand in producing. 

In the below example the woman had an affair (while married), but the ex-husband is forced to pay child support. He was very aware the kid had no biological link. By the way, producing children by another man (who is NOT your husband) while married is another huge and different problem altogether. 

http://www.nlrg.com/family-law-legal-research/bid/76872/FAMILY-LAW-Paternity-by-Estoppel-Enforced-When-in-Best-Interests-of-Child

In this scenario the man married a divorced woman with children. He is now responsible for child support by way of former marriage. 

https://www.ovlg.com/education/2-rare-scenarios-when-stepparents-are-forced-to-pay-child-support.html

This is also being applied in instances of cohabitation and in extreme cases when the man never lived with the woman at all, but performed stepfather duties and activities with non-biological children.

Any man considering a relationship or marriage to a Single Mother should be aware of these laws. 

The insult is that many SMs perceive themselves as having the same value as never-married, young, pretty, single, and childless women.

Do it if you want kids.

It you don't then there's literally no other reason to get married.

I'm going to propose in  a year or so to a woman I've been with for 9 years and want to have children with. She's very feminine, understands the captain/1st mate dynamic and will be able to work part time while raising the children and work full time for more money when the kids are in school.

Yeah, the problem is you need to have a very high standard for friendship.

If you let anyone in, of course your friends are garbage. I have a higher standard for friends than I do for romantic relationships and the results speak for themselves. I have two friends, both of whom I've been friends with for longer than ten years. One of them I worked with and had the *chance* to fuck me over for money and didn't take it.

If you had someone you considered a friend who fucked you over for fifty bucks, that just tells me you're a poor judge of character.

No Kidding. The just friends thing is what ended my marriage (praise be to allah). They were just friends when she lied about where she was because she knew I’d be upset. She was just having a beer on his porch, though. They were just friends when she made out with him “for a few minute while drunk,” but of course she stopped him. They were just friends when I was devastated and heartbroken that I had been cheated on. They were just friends when she continued texting him while we were trying to work out our differences. They fucked the night she moved out. 
Now, they hate each other, I got a new job making six figures, and fucking girls 15 years younger than me, and she is begging for me back at least once a week. Women are ridiculous.

I thank God for my best friend. I had honestly given up on male friendships. 95% of Men are shitty, self-centered, bitchy, flaky, unreliable and petty. At one time I thought there was something wrong with me till I met my current best friend and I realised there are respectable men still left. We have been friends for over 2 years now. He is working, I have just finished college so he is more financially stable than me. The guy paid for my graduation party expenses and hired a vehicle that carried my family. Even my parents were surprised. In case am not well-off financially and we want to go out, he will deliberately give me money before we hit the club so that the girls think we are sharing the costs. He may be beta but he says he would rather spend money on a dude than waste it on a bitch. This is a code he lives by and he has even offended some women by telling them these straight to their face. I recently met some gay dudes at a fashion event. One of them was hitting on me. I told him I am flattered but I don't get down like that and he said he doesn't mind, we can still be friends. I knew he still wanted to fuck me and I only agreed because I saw them with a group of pretty women and that was a good opportunity to game them. Anyway, the next weekend he invites me out. I meet him outside the club and find him with some other friendsThese all experience made me remember where I was a few years ago-with shitty male friends. Usually when I go to the club with my best friend, the first thing we do is ensure everyone is seated otherwise we will all stand somewhere and wait. We will also stick together throughout the night even if him or me meet other people we know. Now, back to the gay dudes. We go inside the club, they spot a group of girls they know at a table, two of them seat at the two empty seats remaining leaving the rest of us standing. They start talking to these girls without bothering where the rest of us are gonna seat. The other gay fuckers disappear in the crowd for over 30 minutes, leaving me alone with one other guy. Throughout the night, they keep coming back and disappearing. Seriously? What's wrong with these people? These has been my experience with all other male friends I have had in the past. Come to think of it, even straight males are not any different from feminine homosexual males. There is one friend I had like 3 years ago, he was popular in the club scene. The guy would immediately ditch me and spend the entire night trying to convince a girl to go home with him only to come back occasionally after one hour to sip his drink. This was despite telling him I don't like what he is doing and he would rather not invite me out again if he is gonna ditch me.



These are only a few examples. Have had friends that tried hitting on my girlfriend while I was drunk, tell other people personal stuff we had shared in private, flake on me at the last minute after we made plans, try to neg or one man up me in the presence of girls etc. You don't need these shitty people in your life. I always thought I have to be friends with as many people as possible in order to be build a solid social circle. It took me time to realise these is useless unless you are engaging them purely on a business platform. Grown men who lack an iota of masculine dignity and respect should be avoided at all costs. They will cost you in the end. I know people who have lost their jobs after being betrayed by their jealous male friends. Lastly, be careful who share with your personal issues, otherwise, they will be used against you by those same male friends you trust.




Edit: For those concern trolling me, let me clarify, my best friend is straight, we have been friends for over two years so I should know. The gay dudes that I hanged out with once are not my friends. I am not a homophobe like you and if hanging out with gay men once means getting easy access to HB9s then fuck yeah, I am gonna do it. Am also not financially dependent on my best friend like some of you are trying to insinuate with your psychoanalysis. I have helped him a few times too when he was in a fix and regularly pay for drinks when we go out. I was simply giving an example to illustrate why he is a good friend.

A lot of TRP I've read is against having female friends. I have one or two close female friends that I have no interest in fucking. They know me pretty well and have advertised me as an asshole to most of their social circle. Over the weekend, I was with one of them and her friends at a party. Since my friend did the "dirty work" for me, I was able to easily hook up with one of her friends because she already thought I was Chad before she met me. All I had to do was hold frame. Piece of cake.

Is this a popular strategy around here? Any good readings or thoughts about it?

&gt; Make friends and make friends of your friend

I've never been able to randomly make friends in my entire life. I understand that this is important, but at 27 with a fulltime job taking three courses and school. It isn't easy. Its not easy at all, close to impossible to start friends from scratch. I dunno man, I agree with you, it's just probably the hardest thing on TRP. Cold approaching is much easier.

I had a conversation with 2 friends the other day about gym embarrassment. We're all regulars at the same gym and Friend A is really overweight and Friend B is pretty muscular. Friend A claims that nobody really cares about you at the gym but Friend B claimed that he was wrong. I asked if Friend A cares about what other people do at the gym and he said no. Asked the same question to Friend B and he said that he judges everyone. It occurred to me that the only people who really judge others are those who are really worried about other people judging them.

1850
&gt;I heard through a friend she thought (...)

Mistake 3: Listening to 'he said, she said' through a friend.

&gt;I'm definitely not going to even attempt to contact her or go out again.

Why? Because of what a friend said?

Feel you want to see her again? Ask. If she starts playing hard to get THEN stop your pursuit. Don't preempt it because something someone possibly said. 

P.S. How do you know it's true what that friend said?

18139
&gt; You can never, ever be 100% transparent with a friend, girlfriend, wife, etc. You may have a best friend, but that best friend possesses the ability to sabotage you if he pleases.

This. I had many friends (I'm 60 years old now) with whom I've gone through some real trials, and they passed them with flying colors. Then, for various reasons, they fucked me over quite savagely.

 Friends are like plates: they aren't yours, it's just your turn.

Find women outside of social circle and stay out of hers as much as possible.  If you are friends with her friends she will have a subconscious worry about it getting back to them just how slutty she is, especially after you break up.  If she is not friends with your friends she will be far less concerned about what you say to them.  

16403
I don't agree with the last bit. I have friends, and I have a close group of friends. Even after 10 years there are friends who have helped me as I have helped them. In particular, I got a new job which turned my life around thanks to a close friend of mine. Friendship was over 10 years old and we lived in different countries. 

I do agree with one thing though, I can't expect everyone of my close friends or even one to be there when shit goes down. If they are there, good, if they are not, I'll still figure my way out. But if a good friend of mine is in shit, I will do the best that I can to help him out a hole. Why? Otherwise,  a strong male community/friend circle is just a facade.

I see what you're saying. 

I agree if it isn't making you feel good then don't do it. If you feel used them don't do it. I agree the more post wall they become the more there are ulterior motives to their moves. Just do what's best for you and always look out for yourself.

Didn't plate her because I wasn't interested in fucking her anymore.  http://archive.is/96vx2

&gt; "But what about when she asks why you're not a good fit?"

**"I'm sorry Jane, I just feel it's true. I know in my heart we're not the right ones for each other."**

Again - there's no effective counterargument for feels.

Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head with your reply.  Honestly, I really just want to feel that kind of relief at this point.  I still feel angsty about the whole thing, but overall it does feel like its subsiding on its own every so slightly as the days go on.  Just gotta get here faster haha!

7589
I felt exactly as you guys were talking about, depressed/ low energy after jacking off but that was when I did it daily/ every other day. Now, I do it every 2/3 days and I don’t feel anything/ feel even better. Worth noting that I have prostate  problems and if I don’t ejaculate for extended periods of time ( a few days), it gets hard for me to pee.

Most music tends to guide your emotions, so you're not "working through your emotions" - you're taking a piece of music and using it as "what should I feel now" guideline to put you in an emotional state.

There's absolutely no need (and no benefit) in feeling more angry (or resentful or frustrated and so on) during anger phase. 


&gt;And after every release I feel stronger and more capable than before.

Yes, you do "feel stronger and more capable", but in reality you're not. You just "feel like it" and that's b/c nothing changed in reality, only your feelings did. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I feel the transition from boyhood into manhood and feel grateful. I cry.

This thread is equivalent of a girl crying herself to sleep after a breakup. 

Next time DO something constructive like gym or gaming some girls.

Don’t let your emotions influence where you think you are at, i.e. oh I’m feeling sad, I must not be over her, oh ok, I’m not over her, that’s right. 

Our emotions and thoughts can be in contradiction all the time. For example, there was a military general who said cowardice is not when you feel fear at the front lines, it’s when you act on it. That’s to say it’s completely normal to feel fear in that situation, it’s about what you do with it though.

Same situation here, it’s completely normal to feel sad after a break up. Don’t worry about changing that feeling. You know what’s the best way to make a feeling go away? To not think about it and to keep calm and carry on. It’s like if you told someone to not think about penguins, they’re gonna keep accidentally thinking about penguins. Best way to not have penguins come to mind anymore is to do something else. And if it just so happens that something reminds you of penguins again (i.e. sadness), that doesn’t mean anything about you and work you need to do on yourself.

Watch out for the stories you attach yourself to. Let yourself feel sad, but write your own stories instead of letting your emotions write them. 

20929
That's a really good point.  I wonder how many chicks literally go out just to make out with guys, so that they feel validated while not being feeling like a slut, because she didn't sleep with that dude.  

She will make out with your average joe, but will only sleep with who she feels is much higher value.  I feel like it's a common occurrence.  It's so easy to get the makeout session, only to go home by yourself.

Same here, I feel way better doing it once every 7 days. It peaks around day 7 and then slowly goes back down.

After day 10 I started feeling numb to shit. Like a bitch would eye fuck me and I didnt feel a surge of sexual energy like I would if I was around 4 days no fap. I think its called the hardline where you feel like shit and lose your sex drive.

6204
When I broke up with my girl I said that I felt too insecure being in a relationship (which was half true, the real reason was because she was an untrustworthy hoe, and that'll make any man's cuck-prevention instincts kick in).

This worked perfectly because she can't change how I feel, she can't feel like there's anything wrong with her (as i made the "feels" about myself), and she feels like she has some superiority over me if I appear vulnerable (which decreases the chances of petty revenge, etc.)

There was some post about how if you act beta, she'll be disgusted and want to break up with you, so use that to your advantage, just say you're an insecure bitch and it'll make the breakup go along much smoother.

If you act like some cool motherfucker who doesn't need her anymore and makes her feel worthless (which exactly how I felt but I chose not to act that way), she'll feel the need to get her revenge so she won't feel so small, and that'll come back to bite you.

11798
*Sigh*.

I am not straight but I know how you feel.

I found someone once, ages ago, that I thought I loved. More than anything. He was beautiful, he was sweet. I wanted him so badly. It felt like I was on fire wanting him. Pure Hell, 24/7. I got it in. And I got to know him. And I realized I felt *nothing* for him.

And that was worse. When I felt pain and anger, at least I felt something. After that I just felt nothing and empty. How do you even know you're alive if you don't feel anything?

ask her what are her thoughts on sex in general.. sex within a relationship sex outside of a relationship.. etc. itll give you a good feel for how she thinks about sex which will ultimately tell you whether or not she is gf material. This and hang out with her and her friends a few times to see how they act. One thing I always learned is that hoes hang with hoes. Hope this kinda answers your question. Just be broad about it so as to not make her think you would judge her for her view on sex.

If you don't limit yourself, it's not hard to get sex. Even if you are not wealthy, you can find a dependant woman and use your money as leverage to get sex. Asian women are usually open to arragements like that, and I can imagine it would work with drug addicts as well. You can of course pay for the sex directly as well.

And no, women do not want sex as much as men do. When someone says that it's either bullshit or wishful thinking.

15611
If I were you, I’d promote a high sex drive plate to LTR and fuck constantly.  Don’t get too attached, just use it for sex.  Tell her you will not look at porn and keep your word gold.  This way you have an outlet, sex, and a mission, which is reinforced one and the same.

The above works for me, I haven’t looked at porn in a year, although her sex drive started above mine, so your mileage may very.

&gt; It’s generally true that girls don’t care about sex

Nope - the vast majority of girls LOVE sex *with attractive men*.  The "girls don't like sex" myth comes from women who are dating betas they are not attracted to in order to gain security, social approval, etc.

"I don't like sex" is a way to get beta men to pay for it in various ways.

&gt; Imagine a world where guys are sex obsessed and won’t reduce their sexuality by even the slightest bit. All the while, girls on the other hand, are living their day to day lives not really caring about sex,

Haha girls fucking love sex and think about it all the time.  What's causing the sexual difference isn't that girls don't love sex, it's that they only want it with top men, who they feel comfortable with, are attracted to, and who know how to handle their tests.  Girls need attraction, comfort, escalation and a few shit tests passed to properly enjoy sex.  It's weird to us, but it's just how they are wired.

&gt; I know all the guys here are gonna feel threatened by my post bc it shows trp idealogy is wrong.

It's probably a troll post, however the "girls don't like sex" myth is worth debunking.


19361
&gt; express attraction make them feel sexy, sexual and ready to fuck


Exactly!  Sex is primarily power to a woman.  Sex is primarily pleasure to a man.  See the difference?  One gender uses Sex to get what they want while the other provides what that gender wants in order to get sex.

I can agree with you on this, a least she is recognizing it, which is better than most.

Take a look around at most married men, it's safe to say that over 50% if not 75% exhibit Beta Bucks behavior.  

I have personally heard the outbursts you wrote of, trying to shame/ humiliate me into disinterest.  “There’s something wrong with you. You’re a sex addict. You’re a pervert. All you want is sex.”

Found the following when I was a few months in to reading and working on myself:

&gt;“All You Want Me For Is Sex”

&gt;There are so many good comebacks to this one, but the best one I’ve ever heard came from a marriage counselor. One woman made that accusation against her husband in couple’s counseling: “All he wants me for is sex. To him, that’s all I’m good for.” The counselor shut that down with a simple question: “If that’s true, why would he even stay married to you, since you don’t have sex?”

&gt;This is one accusation that, when you look at it, actually has no force behind it; it’s merely an attempt to push away the spouse who is being refused and make them the guilty party. There is nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with your husband or wife. It’s biblical, it’s natural, and given Paul’s command, in 1 Cor. 7, to not defraud your spouse in the matter of sex, it’s expected. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with your spouse.

&gt;Do you know what is not natural? Not wanting to have sex with your spouse. As I sit here, thinking and writing, it seems that it is only right to return the question: “Just why do you want me? Why do you want to be married to me?”


Don't like chore / starfish sex?  Don't have it.  Want to see a hamster spin into overdrive?  Work on yourself, get in shape, and when she asks you for the weekly chore sex, politely decline.  At first she may be surprised but relieved, after a few weeks or months it may be a different story depending on your situation.

When she finally asks why you don't want to have sex with her tell her (calmly) how you feel about her starfish / chore sex.  Tell her (calmly) how you feel about her shaming you for wanting to have sex with her.



20850
I think it's important to note that when she said the "key phrase", she was on top of me. And then I gave my reply, and she continues to be on top of me.

There was no rational course of action to be taken here. She wanted sex, I wanted sex, we had sex. If she didn't want sex, and I wanted sex, we wouldn't have had sex.

If there was any "pressure" it was artificialltly created in her head and completely one-sided.

You can mention something like "I don't want to move too fast" based on a feeling of principle and then move forward with having sex because her pricipals only exist in a shallow sense. Meaning she'll verbally say something, then act in a completely different way. So at least she has a shred of value to hang on to in her head, even though she didn't actually act that way.
(Thanks for the reply)

That women like sex is obvious. I'm more wondering about pound-for-pound sex drive if all conditions were equal: i.e. in a utopia where sex was easily available for all. 

That women's magazines are focussed on sex tips and the such shows that they are more focussed on securing an alpha or good man than that they are interested in sex in itself. 

Even the "women love sex, but just with 10% of the population" infers that the real enjoyment women are getting are just by being with the 'alpha' and not necessarily the sex in itself. 

19692
Several LTR's I've had were with women who never turned me down for sex once. One of them told me when we first started dating, "Just so you know I will NEVER say no to you for sex."



Her and a few others actually had sex drives even stronger than my own! Imagine 15-year old me, with one notch, and my 15-year old gf is talking dirty to me and wanting sex in public!



Sex drive mismatches can kill a relationship. Having similar libidos is a non-negotiable for me at this point in my life.



Being with a girl who doesn't want sex as much as you can really be soul-crushing. 

13515
"we are not having sex" is just her trying to convince herself that she doesn't want to have sex. If a blue pill was trying to seduce her, she would not even need to say "we are not having sex" because the thought of sex would not even be in her mind.

I notice a lot of new comers here which is great. When I first found this place it changed my life. 

I want to address in more detail some things that cost me a lot of wasted time, energy and money. 

The first things you'll see around here to get started on the path to self improvement are usually; Lift and Sort out your Wardrobe. 

Solid advice, do not ignore. 

Here's some additional practical advice to give some detail to those and help you avoid my mistakes. 

**Diet**

Diet is the foundation of lifting. A clean diet gives you the physical energy to actually put in your workout and the mental clarity to stay disciplined. 

This is step 1. You need to sort out your diet first. It lays the groundwork for everything else. 

Keep it simple at first, more protein, more veg, less processed carbs, no sugar or junk food. Try not to drink calories. 

**Lifting**

Once your diet is nailed down, get yourself a plan for lifting. Don't do what I did and run to the nearest gym thinking you can deadlift like the others. You can't. 

You've been misusing your body and it takes time to adjust. Start out easy, get a plan together for the movements you need, get the form right first, then start adding weights. 

Hire a reputable Personal Trainer for an hour to show you the ropes if you need to. 

Can't afford a gym? Scared of the big dogs looking at you? Fine. 

Go buy a pull up bar and dumb bell set/kettlebell. Outlay is less than 100 bucks. But again, learn to use them properly. They are tools. Use them right. 

**Clothes**

This is where I went wrong. I rushed out and dropped a load of cash on fancy clothes that fit me well. 

Three months later they were all too big for me and had to be replaced. 

Take your time with this, realise that you will not be the same body shape in three months, even in six months if your diet and lifting are on point. 

Don't be like me. Realize this is a long journey, one step at a time. 

I dropped down 2-3 sizes in everything, re-buying clothes six months later cost me a fortune. 

While slimming down or bulking up keep to cheap items, basic T -shirts, shirts etc. 

Never stop. Lift and eat right constantly and you will have a body that won't let you down and that will do half the work of attraction for you. The confidence boost from being in shape is enormous, it's not just physical, your attitude will change and women will pick up on that. Never stop.

 Agreed.  Having one cheat meal here and there isn't going to make you a fat slob anymore than going to the gym once in a while is going to get you jacked.  Both are a kind of building imo. It takes days upon days, weeks upon weeks,  months upon months, years upon years to keep building muscle.  Your diet is the same thing.  You don't become fat or obese because you grab something fat and greasy from a fast food joint once in a blue moon.  It comes from the days, weeks, etc of the food you eat and the excess calories day after day.  No one wants to eat chicken, rice, and broccoli 7 days a week for their entire life.  Even competion bodybuilders go on a little bender here and there on the off season.  But you have to know how to get down to dick skin body fat when the time comes.  If you've never gotten there and don't know how to manipulate your diet (many also have the help of drugs also) to get the results you want then you have to learn that before you hit that supersize big Mac.  But just like lifting your diet needs to be consistent as well. You're going to miss days at the gym and you're going to go on a bender once and a while with your diet.  No biggie as long as it's not an extended bender. 

4985
Ask yourself. Who lift's and who doesn't.

https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-769a2fabde0da14e001df7309c283ce9-c

Take it from someone who played football in high school and stopped lifting afterwards. You will get fat. Yea you may never be obese but at the very least you'll be skinny fat. Lift and develop lean muscle. You don't need to be huge. That only comes from bulking. You control how your body will look like not weights. You don't like your environment? Change it. Always be on point or you risk your woman will run of to superman.

All good, but I would also add that you should lift like crazy, not just lift, if you want to stay lean and even grow some muscle. 

3-4 times a week pushing yourself is necessary. Good idea also focus on bodyweight excerices for a leaner look, especially considering that it gets much easier as you are losing weight.

I went from barely 50 chinups at 86kg in May to 160 chinups in September at 75kg just because of lower weight. And my arms are super veiny and abs are ripped.

Also don't care too much about carbs/fats since you would probabably be eating so little food that it won't make sense to count anything besides protein.

Finally, 1,2g protein per pound of body weight is almost always an overkill. 0,8 will be enough, you can try to shoot for 1g, but it won't change much. Based on all recent research.

I hated being fat (for me that was 205 at 6’2) and I cut down too aggressively without maintaining much muscle to 175. I was too skinny. I think it was still good because it helped put on a lot of lean mass without much fat. This is because cutting made me get good at counting macros and calories and made me fight hard not to gain too much fat. I put on 25 lbs and started cutting again, this time I’m much bigger and my cut won’t be very long.

If you’re above 15% I’d recommend cutting down to 10-12 and immediately start bulking (give yourself a week or two at maintenance, then lean bulk 300-500 cal surplus). Do it until your chest starts getting saggy or your abs are invisible in the best of lighting.

It depends on your body type of course, but I’d rather have low body fat and less muscle than high body fat. High muscle low body fat is of course the best option.

Super low body fat is not a good look on anyone. Keep it above 8%, and maybe 10% is ideal.

I have to agree. The primary reason I am in the gym is for myself, to be bigger and stronger than the next guy.  I'll say this, the 4 years I lifted in college, going from roughly 170 to 190 (10% or less bf) boasted my confidence through the roof and get this, even when I stopped lifting in graduate school and later when working..i still felt the same about my body, even though I am sure my strength dropped and I gained weight.  Guess what?  IT was mostly in my own head where I needed the most gains. 

I also agree it is best to cut down once you reach your weight goal.  You can't be worrying about calories when you are trying to bulk, you just need to eat as much as you gain to put on the weight.  Unless your really overweight and need to lose 20lbs, cutting 5lbs should not be that problematic.

For example, my personal goal is 200, I've never hit 200 
lean.  So I am lifting to hit 200 and then I'll cut back 192-195 where ever 10-11% would place me.

I agree with the last statement. I'm about there except I have less fat more height. My best physique was 188 6 percent or so. But keeping your body fat low only facilitates long term muscle growth, when you're gaining weight.

I'll set you in on a secret that nobody will believe, but I'll mention anyways. You can cardio bulk. It has to be something like cross country running, rowing or swimming that uses a lot of muscle fibers, but since cardio has less of an after burn than lifting, you can gain more mass by reversing the deficit faster. What's more now you're building an endurance base so that when you cut, by lifting weights in the gym, you will recover better and have more energy for intense sets. This is healthier for your body than traditional bodybuilding, but nearly nobody does it because they want to see instant results. Not subtle slow twitch growth under a layer of fat while they're bulking,mand then they won't believe it's possible to train power while cutting. It is is if you have enough body fat and aerobic fitness to use it as fuel for more intense workouts. You don't intentionally cut weight it comes off because you're aerobically strong enough to burn more calories in a workout than naysayers would ever predict.

*Read the edits before commenting / PMing me*

You will NEVER be able to outlift a bad diet. This is a simple reality that everyone who seeks a greater physique should know and understand. I know for a fact you guys know this but you need to APPLY it. Don't just tell yourself that you're going to eat healthy and then drink a beer with a pizza the same evening.

Quit making excuses like 'I deserve to eat that one cheat meal, I worked out 4 times this week!'. This is the kind of mentality that will set you so far back in the long run.

When you first start lifting you will make gains no matter what you eat. If you take it seriously. You will lift heavier weights and your muscles will get bigger. This will go on for a few months, perhaps up to 1-2 years.

You will get used to eating bad and working out, but that is NOT the way you should be doing it. The fact that it works when you start out is maybe the reason why a lot of guys hit a plateau after a certain time. Once you hit that plateau it's hard. Your muscles are big but theres a lot of fat covering it, no definition and it's not as good as it could be. 

If you just started lifting, do not fall into that trap. Start improving your diet right away. Start counting your calories and cut everything unhealthy from your life.

Don't drink soda, drink water.
Don't eat dessert, eat a fruit.
Don't eat fries, eat rice.
Eat home-cooked meals.
Get these vegetables in.

I lifted for a long time without eating right, I built strenght, but I was not lean. I successfully dropped 40 pounds in 8 months by just changing my eating habits. The workouts remained the same, but everything else changed. I feel a lot better than I used to and I wish I had started eating right from the get-go.

If you need help with your diet, feel free to PM me.

EDIT: You cannot go cold turkey and completely change your diet overnight, but you should be trying to improve overtime and set goals. Do not fall into a comfort zone. Cheat meals are obviously a thing, but do not have 3 of them a week. Keep it to a minimum if you're struggling.

Edit 2 : This post is obviously not gonna apply to everybody, we're all different. Some guys can eat whatever they want and stay small, while some have a hard time cutting. That's life. 

Edit 3 : I am NOT a nutritionist nor am I a professional bodybuilder. I successfully achieved a decent cut and I just wanted to share the mentality I had with you guys. This post was for new guys who just got into lifting. I believed they should be aware that a dirty bulk is not the way to go and that if they decided to get into lifting, they should also get into a better diet.

Growing up, I was a fat kid that got no attention from the ladies.  Eventually I manned up and took responsibility and lost the weight.  Life got way better, way more confidence, more attention, etc.  However, I went from fat to skinny fat as a result of just dieting with no exercise.  I was petrified of becoming fat again after experiencing how much better being normal was.  Later on, people started mentioning off-hand that I was skinny.  Sometimes I would get light headed and easily tired.  As a man in his 20's in his supposed physical prime years, I knew it would only get worse.  I looked in the mirror and saw myself as I was: out of shape, low muscle, unhealthy.  So, I manned up and took responsibility and went to the gym.  Not wanting to get fat, I counted calories and macros to do just enough to get stronger and by proxy gain muscle.  I did that for about a year, and stopped making progress after a few months.  I would get injured, drop the weight to recover, get back to previous level, and get sick/injured/miss workouts.  I was dedicated, didn't give up, pushed myself, studied proper form, etc.  Being stuck with a sub 250lb squat and other subpar lifts after a year of gym work, I knew something more than bad luck was wrong here.  I'm not a special snowflake.  So, I manned up and recently took responsibility and started eating more.

In the last few months, I've blown through PR's almost every workout.  Life is better, and now I'm reaching my goals at a resonable rate.  My point is that fat is easily lost and gained.  Unless you're in your teens and early twenties, building muscle is going to be a battle.  Don't fuck around, like I did, with "slow bulking" or "lean gains" for fear of fat.  I'll be clear here, as idiots with poor reading comprehension like to make straw men:  I'm saying don't eat like a pig and dirty bulk.  However, the vast majority of the people on this sub need to realize that once you have a decent foundation of strength and muscle, cutting is much much easier.  Past the first bit of training, you will have to make a choice between losing fat and gaining muscle.  Trying to do both at the same time is going to take orders of magnitude longer than standard bulk/cut cycles.

I have been fat, I have been skinny, and now more muscled.  At the end of the day, if you have the discipline to change your body composition and know you can do it, then being 6-8% more fat for a while to optimize muscle growth won't even bother you.

Im the kind of person that likes to eat healthy as well. I dirty gained when I first started because at 55kg your body doesn't give a fuck what you're putting in to gain weight, but, over time I made my diet more and more lean and I haven't lost any weight, I've only gotten more muscular. 

When I bulk I eat between 3000 and 4000 calories a day. I eat 1lb of chicken breast every day, one protein shake as soon as I wake up on a rest day or after a work out on work out days, then a second shake right before sleep. I eat 3 eggs and one chicken or turkey sausage every day. The rest of my diet is IIFYM (If It Fits Your Macros). For the most part when bulking I ignore my Fat macro. I just make sure to hit my Carb and Protein goals. If I eat too much fat during bulk, i'll just burn it off during cut. The body can only gain something like 2lbs of muscle max a month anyway. At our size it's easier to take on weight however you can and burn the excess fat later, that part comes easy to us. 

As for workouts during bulk, I work out only 3 days a week but focus on heavy heavy lifts. Then when I cut I keep the same strength training program but do HIIT exercises 5 days a week and add some target muscle work on my two non-lift days. ex: biceps, abs, calves, traps.

I'm not very active outside of my training programs, so, for someone like you, you may need a lot more calories in your life. Chicken, protein shakes, greek yogurt, and whole grain pastas are dense protein/carbohydrate foods that are all good things to eat on a daily basis. The number one thing is consistency. Get a calorie tracking app like MyFitnessPal, set goals, break them.

This is exactly what I observed in Polish girls. They seem to adore Hispanic and Italian men, dark skinned, bearded and sharp clothed men, plus Turkish men(yeap that's right) 

They do not like their Polish men because Poles are mostly born to be alphas, they want to play with betas.
And guess what? Spaniards and Italians are well known for how they look beta but act like alpha. Turkish guys are born to be betas, but the alpha ones are really good at being alpha. 

At the end of the day, both sides end the day in bedroom.

&gt;While I don't disagree with what you have said.

It is okay.

&gt;I think you have a different image of what an Alpha male is, an alpha is the man who commands respect and dominates the room. 


According to Tomassi, an Alpha male is one who is unclouded by pretense, afterthought, or conscious awareness of any influence that could have a hope of prompting introspection about his state. 

By this definition, none of us is alpha in the truest sense. I cannot put alpha male in words but I can perceive the traits of one.

&gt;In OP's observation this man is obviously respected, assertive and emotionally independent (IDGAF) and he lifts and takes care of himself and has a strong frame.

Mr. "A" in OP's story is an alpha borne out of situational confidence. But I may be wrong as I haven't met the man IRL.


&gt;OP is a RedPiller (who must be fairly Chaddy, I hope) and has respect for this man and acknowledges him as the alpha. So, obviously he is not a beta, who is pretending to be an alpha(betas lose frame under pressure and start to panic).

I never said anything about OP being alpha/beta. However, from what I read, he most definitely is more than a novice.


&gt;Whether he can slay 100s of pussies like Chad is contextually irrelevant. I think we must focus on the good things and learn.

Yes, but when you say a guy like Mr. "A" is an alpha, I think we can all agree that relying on the safety net of one's cultural background and arranged marriage set by parents is a sexual strategy adopted by a beta male; one deprived of sex from adolescence and just one pussy to fuck. And the woman won't feel the tingles 3 years into the marriage.


&gt;And even if the wife was brought up in a conservative family she would have easily turned the alpha into a beta after marriage, which isn't the case. ( I have personally witnessed a women from a really conservative Indian family who has turned her alpha husband into a beta, so)


This is not shocking at all. Marriage, imho is a lifelong shit-test. 

1. Woman marries alpha.

2. Woman pops out a couple of kids.

3. Man shows signs of affection, breaks off the stoic persona in front of the woman.

4. Woman deliberately works to turn the man into a beta family chump-slave.

5. She then cheats on with the paperboy, milkman, mailman to ensure that her genes survive if the children from her first man die. Because we're just poorly designed replicators in the end and men are more disposable.

Unless the bitch dies first, you have to win through all the little and big shit-tests she puts you through. She wants to see and feel the "Shiva" within you (from Way of the Superior man)...untamable and solid as a mountain.

I have an issue with this but it is mainly resolved through use of terminology. Money is not beta, and AB (Alpha Bucks) is the ideal goal for any man. Is Vladimir Putin, Mike Tyson or Donald Trump a mix of alpha and beta? HEEELLLLLL NO!! They are alpha as fuck and loaded. Do you think Rameses II or Ghengis Khan were in any way beta? They had unlimited power and resources (and therefore bitches). Resources/ money is not inherently beta, it is just the only strategy available to the beta. Do not conflate money, power and resources with beta, this is one of the ongoing mistakes made by many in the manosphere. I don’t give a fuck that some of the retarded books in the MRP sidebar use the terminology of mixing beta with your alpha. Those book were written by beta, non red pilled men, do an image search of Athol Kay if you don’t believe me.

1768
The way I think about it, woman have a dual sexual strategy and the traits that speak to one leg of it are alpha, and traits that speak to the other are beta.

If we take two beta traits like money and supplication, then money is a good beta trait with no downsides. It’s still beta, it won’t generate the tingles that alpha traits do, but it is something women want in a man. Supplication is a bad beta trait since it is also anti-alpha, and women despise low-alpha men.

When we talk about someone being a beta, what we really mean is someone who has very weak alpha and relies solely on his beta traits to interest women (which is a weak as fuck sexual strategy and basically aaying “exploit me and treat me like shit”). Just having money certainly doesn’t make you beta in that sense.

7662
What we don't realize is not every woman or every man is the same. Stop classifing men into 2categories: beta/alpha. Someone who might be alpha in one situation or for someone might be beta in other. And you can't just give us one secret sauce to every woman. Be yourself and see who fits. Chill dude.

During the cavemen era, the alphas hunted and fucked the women, while the betas stayed back and raised the kids with the women. The alphas were getting mad pussy, because all the women wanted to fuck them alphas, and the betas were getting none. And this is supposed to be **the natural order of things**. It's normal and expected for only the top 20% of any species to be able to pass on their genes to the next generation -- this is called sexual selection. In fact, it'd be very abnormal for 100% of the male population to be able to fuck and have their substandard inferior genes passed on. That'd be a dysfunctional species that violates the principle of survival of the fittest.

Given such an unbalanced situation, eventually the betas got jealous of the alphas of course. "Err... Why you all be getting all the puss, while we get none?" one outspoken beta moaned to the alphas, echoed and backed by the other betas, who were numerous. The alphas, who were naturally also the leaders of the tribe, decided that this was a powder keg situation. Civilization couldn't continue, much less prosper, when such a huge segment of the population was so fundamentally discontented. If the betas weren't placated, they'd be mass revolts and violence would erupt en masse (as is the case today where sexually-frustrated terrorists and shooters commit unspeakable acts of violence).

First, the alphas tried just talking some sense to the women. "Why don't you girls just fuck some of these miserable bastards? Take one for the team. Think of it as community service, it's for the greater good!" The women immediately retorted in unison, "UH NO, fuck you! That's fucking gross. We're not fucking doing that, unless you can convince us otherwise with something valuable."

Hmm... Something valuable you say?

So the alphas consulted among themselves for a permanent solution to this problem. Alpha A thought of an idea, "Aha! Okay, hear me out. Well let's just invent this brilliant thing called 'marriage.' We'll say it's a divine mandate from the heavens -- those morons will buy it -- and we'll at the same time brainwash the women into thinking that being a dutiful wife is the pinnacle of existence for a woman." The other alphas erupted in laughter but were curious on where it was going.

Alpha A continued, "We'll hype this 'marriage' thing up so much and normalize it, and we'll even shame those who don't conform to it. Under this 'marriage' system, each man -- hunter or not -- will basically own one woman who wouldn't otherwise want to procreate with him. However, within this marriage structure, he'd be allow to exchange his labor and resources for sex. In a way, 'marriage' allows these losers to cheat the system of nature and bypass women's biological instincts by bribing them with resources."

The other alphas listened on, they knew they were listening to genius history in the making. But wait, one alpha raised his hand and went, "Wait. Why one man and one woman?"

Alpha A rolled his eyes and sighed, "Because we want to maintain balance and equilibrium in the sexual marketplace! If every man gets some, and we hype up this 'monogamy' thing as the 'right' thing, the 'correct' way of life, everything will go smoothly. Civilization will prosper. Don't you get it? If some betas remained unsexed, violence will still happen. So everyone must have a piece of the pie. Not everything needs to be spoken out!"

The other alphas nodded their heads in agreement. Some alphas started to grow concerned, and one asked, "Wait, if all these losers have one woman each, won't there be none left for us?"

Alpha A cackled and laughed boisterously. "No, you fool, these women don't really want to fuck these losers, remember? They're only doing it begrudgingly for these losers' labor and resources. So just fuck them on the down low; they'd happily oblige. While these fools get one woman each for life (eww), we have an unlimited supply of women to fuck. Let these losers take care of these women's expenses. It's a win-win-win situation for everyone."

So the discussion ended, and the alphas started to push this 'marriage'/'monogamy' thing HARD. The betas bought it, and they love it so much as a social contraption, because for once they got to get their dicks wet! YAY! And the alphas also realized the side effect of quelling beta violence is that it also puts lazy unmotivated betas to work, to contribute to economic productivity, and to break their backs and sacrifice their lives in pursuit of the pussy and thus the greater good of society!

And thus marriage persisted till today. There ya go, marriage in a nutshell.

Honestly, if you're anywhere remotely alpha with any number of options, the thought of monogamy wouldn't even occur to you. You KNOW marriage is the stuff of betas, invented by alphas as some kind of pity gift for the sad-ass betas. And this will also be the same story I tell to my relatives who badger me with questions about why I'm approaching 30 and still single... And hopefully, so will you.

I feel like the over dramatization of beta qualities in media/pop culture is due to the fact that anyone representing these qualities is already Alpha by default. 

The actors who play the white knight lead roles, the rock stars that sing about pining for some chick... these men/characters are already very Alpha in both looks and status, so when beta BS comes from their mouths, it's seen as attractive because it balances out their already alpha state into that "mostly alpha but some beta" balance that makes women swoon. 

These men are the idols for the younger generation, who don't realize that beta game only works if you're already super alpha. Then you have a slew of teens who preach the same beta morals they see in the movies, but don't have the alpha super hero powers or good looks to back them up. 

1741
&gt; That's what most alphas do in the animal kingdom

Wrong, mammal alphas don't lock down anything, they just have it because they are biggest and strongest, betas challenge them for mating rights. They don't signal to the betas that they have to challenge them, if they want some of his harem, the females signal that by fervently resisting their advances.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcLMNcWZOc

This is more like whats going on, the alpha walks around doing alpha sh*t, and the least beta of the betas walk up and challenge him (and obviously loses, because he's a small beta).

My friend, no one is acting. If you being a beta equivocates to happiness, then why not be beta? You saying something is about something and not something is all part of the intellectualization game, the "trying" game. This is not true abundance. When you Let Go, you find the truth, and the truth is that there's no such thing as being unhappy and being who you really are at the same moment in time. If your naturally alpha as fuck but it doesnt make you happy, don't be alpha. If being beta is painful, become alpha. But the thing is, if it were truly that painful to be a beta, you would've already become an alpha. The pain would've forged you into that sort of man. Yet here most of us are, pretending we want to become alpha when we really dont.

I think you're probably right. They're less smart than us in some ways, but smarter than us in others.

The good in me (or beta perhaps) in me wants to believe there's some good in them.

An interesting alpha/beta thing on women. I want both too. Alpha female (hot) for fucks, and beta female (good girl) for support.

Yeah, I think you're probably right. It seems beyond a shit test to me - the goal is to get something, not to even test the person. 

It happened to me recently with a ridiculous request and it threw me off, cause it's the first time it's happened to me. I responded like it was a shit test but it felt like a complete lack of respect for me to even try for that crap. 

18756
Those disses are one form of shit-tests in the particular scenario you describe.  'Shit-test' is just a broader term that could encompass a lot more than a direct insult.  It's basically anything a woman throws at you for the sake of gauging your alpha traits from your response.


A pressure-flip is a technique for passing a shit-test.  Basic example: 

- Woman you're seeing complains why you aren't paying for her (relatively low-effort shit test)

- "I thought *you* asked me out for this.  Shouldn't the one asking be the one who pays?" (flips the pressure so now she has to make the excuse not to pay)

shit tests are **NOT** a sign of disinterest. it just means a girl is still trying to figure you out. if you consistently crush all of her shit-tests in a good way, that's very attractive and will turn her on.

never getting shit-tested is actually a very bad sign because that means the girl thinks she knows exactly what type of man you are and isn't interested in learning more about you ie she thinks you're an unattractive, uninteresting beta.

13278
Legit interpretation. 

You listened to her &amp; heard everything she had to say, and accepted it. 

But because you held frame, she entered your world, and remained in the relationship on your terms, with little linguistic exchange on it, other than you swatting her shit tests away like flies. Great job. 

I've done this on a few occasions. It's worth the minor trouble if having a deep roster of plates is your main purpose in life relative to women and sex. 

Also it's good practice to have to deal with shit tests &amp; frame challenges. Guys act like it's a hassle, like they are somehow disrespected when a woman shit tests you. 

Women only shit test men they want to sleep with, or keep sleeping with.

And "Dear Zachary" will rip out your soul, throw it into a big pile of dogshit, take a fresh shit on top of that shit, pick all that shit sandwich up, stick it in a blender so both shits permeate every microcosm of your soul, then put that mess in the freezer, then take another shit on your barely frozen shit infested soul before lighting the whole house on fire by leaving another flaming bag of shit on the porch.

Amazing movie.

13181
When a girl gives you a shit test, it is because she is somewhat interested in you. She's interested in you enough to try and test your frame. Shit tests don't determine how much a girl is into you.

Some girls won't shit test you but still be interested in you. One of the only ways to determine if a girl is 'fuck yes' about you is based on her actions. What does she go through to see you? How's her affection towards you? etc.

2814
If you don't want to deal with shit tests, consider these two scenarios:

-  She shit tests - You Agree and Amplify, and she laughs and it spawns a positive emotion in her.  This amuses her gooey-retardness of a brain and her tingles, so she wants MORE and will continue to shit test for dumb reasons because she EXPECTS these feel good tokens to pop out.

Or.

-  She shit tests, you ignore completely, and nothing further takes place.  You have no burden of responsibility for PROVIDING a response to make her feel all gooey and tingly, or heaving forbid annoyed, pissed, and turned off with the wrong response.

Take option 2

The #1 rule in dealing with people being assholes, being arrogant, or making fun of you when it comes to surface level interaction:

Laugh.

Find humor in it. Humor provides a level of detachment, of separation and enjoyment. **When someone’s fucking with you, if you are taking it seriously, you’ve already lost.** The more seriously you take it and the more worked up you get, the more they relish in having control over you. The more worked up **they** get and the more funny **you** find it, the more in control of the situation it puts you. The key is to shift the power dynamic. Find genuine humor in it. 

People can tell when something has pierced your emotional defenses and is pissing you off. Being angry is vulnerable- it means something got to you. People will pounce on it. I’m not saying never get angry or never take certain situations seriously; if there is actual conflict that needs your engagement, by all means, take it seriously, get angry, and at that point if people give you shit for getting worked up it won’t matter because the situation matters enough to you that you don’t care if you get made fun of. Cultivate yourself so that when important conflict arises, you are not afraid to stand up and face it. But surface level interactions, like shit tests, people making passes at you, and social annoyances are not the time nor the place for that. It just displays emotional weakness. 

If you get upset, make a big deal about it, and fail the shit test, people will note that you are emotionally weak. But more importantly than that, you ARE emotionally weak. With passing shit tests, the emphasis is often placed on the opinions of others and not wanting to lose face, and that is important, but more important is the state of YOUR being, and being able to deflect shit tests and not only *come across* like it doesn’t bother you, but for it to *actually not bother you*. Would you rather have people think nothing bothers you but it actually does, or have people think something got to you but it really didn’t? When you get good at passing shit tests, both externally AND internally, you can have the best of both worlds- where nothing bothers you and everyone knows it.

**Externally** passing shit tests is what is you can read about in the sidebar- the techniques and things to say to deflect shit tests verbally, to not show any signs of weakness or vulnerability. Agree and amplify, pressure flip, etc… my favorite low effort one is when someone tries to insult you and you can tell they’re reaching a little bit far, and so you just look at them, and let it sit in silent for a second… raise your eyebrows like you would when looking at a puppy and thinking 'awww', maybe even give them a condescending pat on the back as if to say *"Nice try,”* and let them stew in their own embarrassment of a backfired shit test. Point is, externally passing shit tests is what you do to show others you were not phased by it.


**Internally** passing shit tests is what you actually feel. If after an interaction you are thinking about what the person said and are feeling upset by it, you find yourself growing angry, you have internally failed. It means you have too much self-doubt, to the point that you are basically shit testing yourself, and subconsciously asking yourself *“What if what they said is right… what if my taste in music DOES suck? What if my mom IS a whore? Maybe I AM a bitch.”* The part that probably bothers you the most is not just the fact that you were shit tested, but the fact that you felt like you failed it. And that you watched yourself fail it- you saw the limits of your being in that moment and saw your insecurity and inadequacy shine forth. If you feel like this after a shit test- regardless of how well you handled yourself, regardless of whether or not the people present felt that you passed it- you failed. Because you’re thinking about it. And it’s bothering you. So what do you do?

The first step is to be honest and admit that it is bothering you. If you lie to yourself to act tough you will just feel like more of a bitch. Acknowledge that, at least in this situation, and probably in other avenues of your life, you are a bitch. Once you acknowledge this there is a sense of freedom- there is no holding onto ego, there is no “ma alpha fucks” bullshit, it’s just you being honest with yourself: you failed a shit test. It pissed you off. It’s bothering you. You are not as mentally strong as you want to be, and you want to get better, you want to be stronger, so that next time a similar situation comes up you will be able to deflect it and not give a fuck, and leave the other person looking like a bitch. But to get to where you want to go, you have to figure out where you are. Right now the bitch is you. Good. Now you are at square one.

Where do you go from here? 

Realize that everything you’re feeling is just insecurity. Realize everyone has insecurity. Even Chad, at some point, has undoubtedly failed a shit test, and was ruminating it over in his mind that night getting pissed off and feeling like a bitch. Everyone feels insecurity to some extent. There is one (primary) root cause of insecurity: you do not believe you are adequate. You do not believe you are good enough, you’re not good enough to be the kind of person you want to be, and because of that you do not respect yourself.

You **can** cultivate a state of mind and self-image that does not care about petty things- insults people throw at you, words spoken by people who are probably more insecure than you- these things do not have to bother you. They do not have to have power over you. And this starts with having discipline, building yourself up to be someone you respect, keeping your promises to yourself, sticking to decision you’ve made- if you repeatedly tell yourself you want to start working out, start eating healthier, start doing better in college or at your job, and you never do, or maybe you’ll get on it for a week and then quit, you will not respect yourself. Respect is earned, not given, and likewise you cannot just *give* yourself your own respect. You have to **earn** your own respect. Respect is subconscious. And you earn it through maintaining your frame; through making decisions, and having the discipline to follow the fuck through on them. Don’t sit around all day talking; DO something. While someone else is busy and trying to build themselves an empire of words to live in and feel good about themselves, you can be out there DOING things- pump that fucking iron, eat those vegetables and chicken breasts, get out there and make yourself a king- ESPECIALLY when you don’t feel like it. If you only grind when you feel like grinding, that’s not discipline; that’s just you doing what you feel motivated to do in the present moment.

tl:dr By cultivating discipline and following through on the things you know you should be doing, you will earn your self-respect and you will feel confident, and when people try to put you down, you won’t give a fuck. Because you’re too busy living your life and basking in self-validation to care. Externally or verbally passing shit tests is the easy part- just know some words to say. And you should know how to verbally pass shit tests. But passing the ultimate shit test- the quiet one, the shit test that your own subconscious is doing to you, poking your frame, trying to see if you are someone who is worthy of your own respect- THAT is the ultimate shit test you should be trying to pass. And the only way to pass is to have discipline, so that when it's time to grind and do the things you know you should be doing and you hear that little devil floating next to you saying "nahh, just relax, it's too much effort" or "ah, you didn't really want it that bad anyway," you smack that bitch to the ground and you DO what you need to do.

All of that and more is within your grasp.

Now get off the internet and go work out.

Shit tests are actually tests that a man would do aswell. Wouldn't you testride the shit out of a car you were going to buy? Do shit that you wouldn't normally do, just because you can? When it passes those stupid shit tests you are throwing at the car, it only makes you feel more thrilled, more amazed, more everything. You become fucking hyped and love the car even more.

That's how women think. They want to play with your strong frame, they want to break it, yet love it it doesn't budge. But once it does, it's like the kitty got the toy. It loses interest.

11742
You would think the point of shit testing is so that if the guy passes, you'd be more attracted to him.  
 
But she made it that the only way for him to win is to leave her, thus making it so that she doesn't meet him.  
  
So why the fuck did she shit test him?

May get a few down votes for this, but I'd like to share some ideas. 

Yes, AWALT. However, if you have decided to have an LTR, presumably on some level you actually like the person.

If you like the person, and want a fulfilling relationship with any woman, providing her with a sense of security is important. You don't want your partner to be insecure in a LTR. The entire point of an LTR is to provide mutual support.

The idea that a woman faced with long term dread, lack of any reassurance, and reminders of your lack of legal and or financial attachment, would not be irreparably insecure is a ridiculous idea. Insecure woman will go out and cheat for validation, or to branch swing.


A belief that your woman will cheat will probably lead to them cheating. Why the hell would you want to be in a relationship while you believe that anyway? This is not a passive thought you're referring to. It's the systematic execution of a plan throughout one's life. All that while you have the plan in the back of your head to walk away with a wry smile at the end? What's the point? Sounds like a shallow and empty existence to me.

Far better to instead choose a different focus. If you do decide to marry, go into that marriage wholeheartedly, and believe in your wife's fidelity. Put your focus instead on achieving your life's mission and don't concern yourself with the idea she may cheat. You're better of remaining single that doing that.

8725
every girl has potential to cheat on you, and also branch swing, look at celebs and pro sport guys who get cheated on

only blue pillers disagree

that's the reason why plates and fwbs exist. just dont be monogamous / marry them and it doesnt matter if they cheat or leave. Plates &amp; FWBs defeats awalt.

Upvoted this comment. It's not black or white when it comes to cheat meals but if you want to hold yourself to a higher standard you have to have more discipline. 

I do a cheat meal or two every month, because as the original comment said, life happens. I have rich clients want to take me out to some fancy steakhouse, or I want to celebrate a holiday with my family. Shit happens. 

But sometimes you have to say no. If you keep coming up reasons to cheat all the time it no longer is a cheat meal. 

If you want to get to 10% BF like me you are going to have to go extended periods of time without cheating. If you cheat at 25% BF who cares, you are still a fatass. But going from 25% to low BF takes discipline. 3 years ago I cut from 25% BF to 10% and I only cheated once a month max, sometimes 2 months without cheating. 

9888
You must still be in the anger phase. A lot of girls cheat and all of them have the possibility of cheating. But that does not mean they all cheat. A successful LTR is very possible and several of the top contributors here maintain LTR's. If you follow TRP principles and are always willing to walk away then you can have a successful LTR. The key is to never be in a situation where you can't walk away from it. You also need to ruthlessly screen your LTR for any red flags that don't meet your standards. 

15953
No woman would ever cheat on you in their right mind if you are the best of the best. If you get cheated on it has got nothing to do with you you're either not the best of the best or she's still hunting. Don't be upset because you got cheated on, not everyone can be the best.

6591
&gt;  If she "cheats"? NEXT!!

1. You won't know if she cheats.  Women usually get away with it.

2. "it doesn't matter / next" is fine if you're not invested.  If you want an exclusive LTR, if you put money in, if you marry, or if you have children - her cheating really fucking matters.


13689
&gt;your girl will cheat eventually

AWALT and exit strategy, yes. Not a fan of "your girl will eventually cheat" though. A lot of guys will misinterpret this and enter into a relationship with a frame based on fear, which will prevent them from enjoying their time with their woman.

Following a couple of simple rules can help protect against the risk that your woman could eventually cheat - 

* Don't enter a LTR unless you have abundance. Men with other options usually don't obsess over cheating and are less likely to stick around if a woman does cheat.

* Never get so attached to a woman that you lose your independence - the ability to do what you want when you want, including walking away from a bad relationship.






16097
&gt;Never stop cultivating your worth, and never stop having "options" so that you make act on them if necessary. **This does not mean you need to cheat, obviously**, but if you don't make other women jealous, your woman will be insatiable, and will cheat on you.

No. Guys should cheat. I don’t understand this sub’s obsession with remaining faithful. I promise you, when she cheats on you she’s not feeling an ounce of guilt. You should always be improving your SMV, working out, making contacts, attracting women and having discreet dates. If your relationship with your actual girlfriend starts to peter out, start looking at your alternatives. A mentality that’s necessary is that a lot of these girls are more or less interchangeable with slight alterations. These relationships are transient, so don’t turn down an opportunity for the sake of remaining “faithful,” because again, they can and do cheat without feeling guilt. Get into a relationship, make it exclusive, and [cheat](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hIob7qv6qtE).

So you've just learned women cheat sometimes? Well so do men. That's the ugly truth. A lot of married people have cheated at least once in the relationship. It's not a women issue. It's a human issue. When we're young we're brought up thinking cheating is something that never happens but as well get older we start to learn that's false. It's extremely rare for someone to only fuck the same person for 40 plus years. If you pick a good person it might mean no cheating or maybe just the one night of passion with another man. If you pick a bad one you're obviously going to get cheated on all the time. The exact same thing applies the other way. I've cheated on girls and, who know's they have probably cheated on me. That's life.

12189
You think cheating is fun?   I can see that ... I'm sure most women who cheat in committed relationships feel the same way, as do many guys.  Although I figure guys do it for sex women for excitement/feelz. 

My issue would be cheating while saying you are in a LTR/committed relationship.  I just think cheating because you assume she is cheating (because AWALT) then what exactly is the point of a LTR?  Just plate or never commit in the first place if that is your intention.

I stopped playing video games something like 3,5 years ago, if not longer. I even TRIED to play something last year, but it wasn't giving me any fun i expected to. Now, I can't stand somebody playing video games, perfect waste of time, instead of it i'm finishing some work and school projects, lift and play guitar and feel that this is productive way of spending time.

21080
I cold approach all the time and it works very well for me. That being said I only approach if:

1. She is attractive enough that I would regret not approaching
2. She gives me a IOI.

This goes for day and night game. I DO NOT spam approaches and I DO NOT just run up to random women on the street and step in front of them.

Making video game videos is still making something, compared to just playing video games. You tell someone (guy or girl) that you play video games as a passion they will scoff. You say you have a YouTube channel, X number of subscribers, advertising deals with Y, met celebrity Z because of it and all of a sudden they are drawn in.

Though I agree with you that if you have a naturally good looking guy who puts the gym and diet effort to get shredded but also loves video games and plays hours a day he wont have trouble getting laid and women will be drawn in. But that is because the other aspects are so strong, and not because of his video game passion.

6214
Simply put, a man playing video games is not sexually attractive to a woman.  You can play them, you can play them all you want, just don't do them in front of your woman.  

A woman watching a man play video games is like a man watching a woman eating big macs.  It's that repulsive.  It's how the sexual dynamics work.  And I love playing video games.

Good post. 

Social circle game is nothing but network marketing pussy. It is a lot more efficient than running direct sniper approach game. 

People have no idea how truly easy it is to get set up with comp tables and bottles at nightclubs and how much easier the game gets from having your own or sitting at somebody else's. 

Photographer and promoter game is almost cheating in terms of fucking hot pussy with the amount of game you actually employ on them. ROI is insane.

holy shit your story describes me perfectly. I hate losing, I hate playing just for fun, fun is when I win. When I stopped doing sports and started playing video games, the mentality didnt change and I played so many hours a day until I became top ranked (5%&gt; of all players) at a big variety of games (SoF2, CsGo, LoL, Starcraft2, Tekken).

The point came when I was too old to just play games 24/7 because school ended and I had to choose a career and earn money. Also, being good at video games is useless except you are famous/sponsored/progamer.

The goal now is to become as rich as possible, as fast as possible to not be working with other retarded losers in a team and be paid just like the rest of losers who love to waste their time drinking, talking about soccer games and brag how much they puked from the alcohol at weekend, their only free time in the week.

I try to use the experience I gained, which was playing at a high level in sports and many video games, and apply the ideas, mindset and work ethic in other aspects of life, like finances.

Fuck being average.

19484
Because there's a chance that the girls might be fucking him for his money (to use the example above). At the end of the game, chasing money isn't the end game.  Getting fucked for money is like playing a video game with a cheat code. Fun at first, but then boring because there's no challenge, no lessons learned, no growth. It makes the game pointless.

I used to play a ton of CS and a few other games.  I played them too much and they went from being fun to being competitive and felt like work.  When I look back on my life, I almost always remember people and activities or places I've been, and never the games I played, no matter how much I enjoyed them.  I never have nostalgia for my gaming days, and your online friendships don't benefit you, because how are those guys improving themselves if they are always gaming too?

My gaming cpu died a few years ago and I had stopped entirely, but I recently acquired a new laptop and tried out one of my old games for old times sake.  I realized the games never made me happy, just frustrated, and they stole so much time and life from me.  I used to regularly reject offers to go out and do something with my college buddies because I wanted to game.  You know it's toxic to play it, especially if you are good at it because you feel rewarded, like you are improving at something, and better than others at something, but that something will never pay your bills and it will never stick in your memory.  

I know it's hard to stop playing a game, but you at least recognize it's bad for you if you play too much.  I had friends who could play an hour or so a week and be fine.  I couldn't do that, I had to full stop.  Good luck.

3965
&gt; Or, it just means that you don't want to play the game. Sometimes the best way to win the game is not to play at all.

Copout hamstring. You don't want to play a game in which you will lose against cool Chad with his cool, popular instagram account and lambo pics.

12910
Best advice I've seen on here about game. 

Running direct spam approach "natural game" is the fucking worst form of game and in my opinion for peasants. I don't even consider it game. 

Sad this type of game is still getting taught and used. If you need to approach 30 women in a day just to fuck one, you don't have game.

Maybe I was wrong about this sub, but I am seeing a lot lately that makes pussy one of the main goals. That is a big mistake. Pussy should never be the center of your life. It's great and all, but it should be icing on the cake. The central goal, and all the main goals should be about making the best of your life. A nice side effect of that kind of life is that quality pussy will be pulled like gravity to that kind of life. But not a great endgame goal for life.

&gt; Your life sounds just so good. Everything so idealistic and wonderful that it screams of bullshit.

..and your opinion matters for what reason? I'm living this life, I don't need to prove it. Certainly not idealistic, they're just the highlights of my lifestyle that I've managed to achieve by "taking charge of my life", as you put it.

Do tell us how you've taken charge of your life recently, because as it stands, and looking at your post history, you just seem like a man with a lot of words and no action.

I'll add my .02 to #2... life is what you make of it. What do YOU want?

What do you want to spend the most time on, and where do you want it to lead? Do you want kids? Do you want to have fun til you drop? Do you want both? Life is much about enlightening yourself and what you want right now may change in a few years, and may change again after that; only you can decide that. 

The most optimal model would be the one that works for what you want out of life. What is your end goal (which you should ask yourself more than once)

You're still wanting the Disney fairytale. I know how it ends, the same way it always does. Get used to it. 

Get yours, enjoy the time you get with people because they aren't going to be in your life forever. There will come a day when it's the last time you see them, that's how life works.

You're not going through the motions, you're getting what you want from life. Fucking hot girls is fun,, enjoy it for what it is and forget the idea that you want to keep her. Every girl I wanted to fuck 20 years ago has zero chance at even seeing my dick, I'll fuck her daughter though. I have more important shit to do in my life, more fun things too, and girls soak up the time and resources i need to do those things.

Get used to it, that's life man.

**Summary:** 2 years after being introduced to TRP by a good friend of mine, my 10+ years of continues depression is gone, and I'm legitimately happy. Everyone has rough patches but you need to evaluate your own life, figure out what’s important to you, and get after those goals. (Sorry if I lose my train of though at times, this was longer than expected, feel free to ask questions however)

**Body:** 
About me: I've never posted on here before, however I've been around for a couple of years now. My story is slightly different than the ones I've seen posted on here before, and after seeing the recent CNN hit piece I figured I'd give my own version. Currently I'm a 25 year old white guy, I lifted like it was my religion for many years prior to being introduced to TRP, and didn't really struggle with women. My problem was that I was still very unhappy with life as most of it still didn't make sense to me. I seemed to be doing everything that I was told I'd need to do to be happy but it just didn't seem to be working. Half of my life I was raised by family members without seeing my parent for a stretch of 7 years, after which they had decided to take over parenting (Age: 10). I had to move to another country where I did not have any friends, and couldn’t even make any if I tried as I didn’t speak the language. My new household was dysfunctional with an abusive dad who ended up going to jail a couple of times for it. It had gotten to a point where suicide was considered daily by me until my mom was finally able to get rid of him (Age: 14). After that, she fell into her own streak of depression which she still hasn’t climbed out of. I had no adult male figures my entire life, and no one to give me any sort of expectations for adulthood. I was raised by internet and TV like many of the people here. 
College Years: Most TRP principals I was able to pick up on my own prior to my introduction to it, but lifting was the only one I practiced. I still thought I had to be the typical beta male provider, hold women up on a pedestal, and basically live the typical white picket fence life; none of which made me happy. My interactions with women were still very beta like, the only reason why I didn’t struggle with women despite that was 100% because of my looks (5’11, 187 Lbs, 7ish % BF. Gym was life). I had a couple of girlfriends which ended up being unhappy relationships for both parties involved. Failed every shit test there was, in and out of relationships. I still sometimes kick myself in the head for how many times I had very attractive women hit on me in college just for me to ruin that interaction by my beta like behavior. I don’t have many regrets in life, but if I could go back to being 18 but keep my current knowledge, I definitely would. It’s like Dom M. said “If you’re lucky, you’ll graduate college with a degree. If you’re smart, you’ll graduate with gains.” Getting fit was the only smart thing I did during those years. I have a business degree and I can honestly wipe my ass with it because that’s how much it’s worth to me. 

Currently: Up until about 2 years ago I was still very depressed. Failed relationships, could pick up women but not keep them, still living my life the way I was being told by my mom and the rest of the family. Was introduced to TRP and told to just read the side bar and a few books, and man did everything click for me. It was exactly what I’ve always been told to suppress and not do. I quit taking shit from family and everyone else. I started getting into all sorts of hobbies primarily on my own (travel, photography, shooting, Bushcraft, cars/motorcycles, etc). At this point I have hobbies to keep an interesting conversation going with just about anyone, which has been extremely beneficial in both personal and professional life. I promise you that it’s extremely beneficial if you can connect with someone at the top in your work place on something that they are passionate about. Depending on your ability to develop relationships, it’s almost guaranteed that they will go out of their way to help you out in the future. Being Raised by only women my entire life, I realized how my own mother was manipulating me regularly after reading a few threads on here with similar examples, so I put a stop to that. I ended up getting into another relationship where I was able to test the TRP principals from the very start and it was legitimately a happy relationship the entire time. Didn’t as much as have a single argument with the GF up until I broke it off with her for a certain trait she displayed that was a big no no for me. Did the whole hook up thing during my anger phase after realizing how stupid easy it is if you just implement the TRP teachings properly, and got over that as well. I agree to a high degree with how the founders and some of the contributors go about approaching TRP, the only thing that I take a different approach on is talking about it. Typically on here it’s stated that you shouldn’t talk about it, and that rule should definitely apply to your work place considering the current political environment. In personal life however, I am very open about it. I’ve openly discussed these principals with friends and women that I’ve dated, and have yet to get a bad negative response. Your mileage may very on your delivery however, but it has helped me in my personal relationships. Just make sure you actually practice what you preach or you’ll end up with the opposite results. I’m currently saving up money and working on getting into a career field that I’ve wanted to get into since I was a little kid but was always told no by my family. I have some very defined goals that I’ve sat for myself for both professional and personal life. Still picking up hobbies regularly (although they are starting to get more complicated). I take responsibly for my own actions and my own life and don’t let anyone else control the direction of it which gives me an absolute sense of freedom and happiness. I take responsibility for my own actions and have a very solid understanding of what I can and can’t control. I don’t frequent this place much, but I still practice and will continue to practice for the rest of my life as TRP was the single most life changing thing in my life. By no means do I think I have every answer in life, but I did happen to figure out at least some of what makes me happy and what I want to work towards after having no direction in life and wanting to sort of end it all together. 

**Lessons Learned:**
1.	“Tough situations don’t last, tough people do.” For those that maybe are in a shitty situation right now with home life or anything else, always keep in mind that there’s likely a solution to your problem. Take control of your own life and get yourself out of it. 
2.	If you’re not already fit, get fit. I was a fat until college so I can speak from personal experience that there is night and day difference in how you’ll be treated by both men and women. 
3.	TRP is a tool box, not a definitive 12 step program for recovery. Take only what you need. Figure out what is lacking in your own personal situation and then figure out the proper approach to solving it. I certainly don’t agree with everything and everyone here, but there is way more good information than bad.. in the side bars at least. 
4.	Don’t stay angry with life, it’s not going to change anything for you, you’ll just be mad. Realize that this is what life is. I get that it sucks when that realization hits you first, but finally knowing the rules that you will be playing the rest of your life by will make everything ten times easier. 
5.	And finally my most important lesson learned: do exactly what you want in order to make you happy. If you’re idea of happy is living in a van down by the ocean then go for it regardless of what anyone says. If you’re idea of a happy life is snorting coke in between a hookers ass crack then go for that too. From my interpretation of TRP, it’s not a certain life that you must live but more about you finally taking control of your life. 

**Suggested reading and links**
1.	“The Rational Male” if you’re new is a must to get a basic understanding. I think this is the best way to be introduced to TRP, period. 
2.	“The Way of Men” I love Jack Donovan’s stuff. It will definitely be more depend and on your personality. I always had an idea of what he writes about in my mind, it was just great being able to finally see that put into words. He has other books, all of which I’ve read, and I do recommend all of them. However if you do not like nor agree with this book then the other ones will be the same for you. 
3.	Get a book on something that you’re passionate about and get good at something. A personal example is “Long Range Shooting” by Cleckner. Taught me more than internet could on this topic, and I always have it as a resource to refer to. 
4.	I’m going to include a few links that I’ve picked up in threads here over the last couple of years that go back to the core principals relating to the dating aspect. These are all studies. If you’re having a hard time swallowing the pill by taking the word of the people on here then maybe read these: [Why Is Muscularity Sexy? Tests of the Fitness Indicator Hypothesis]( http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/Frederick_Haselton_2007_Muscularity_sexy.pdf) , [Women's Sexual Strategies: The Evolution of Long-Term Bonds and Extrapair Sex]( http://pillse.bol.ucla.edu/Publications/Pillsworth&amp;Haselton_ARSR.pdf) , [And more by Pillsworth Haselton]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=pillsworth+haselton).

&gt; l courting a girl involves trying to prove to her you have the means to make life better for her.

No it doesn't.  This is getting very close to beta / provider strategy.

The way you want to make her life better is her thinking "my life would be better if this guy was fucking me".

To be frank, I've lived the hedonistic party life my first year of college and it's not for me (15 girls freshman year and at the end of the year ended up in the hospital almost overdosing on xans/alch/kush). I realize I have been given a second chance at life, I almost lost it all and I want to build my financial independence and get out of the Rat race. I am focused on my grades and beating my porn addiction that came about after a 1 year relationship (soph year). I agree with this post, however, I do not think that LTR's are Beta if they are viewed with the lens of abundance, I think it's an ethical contribution and a willingness to become a whole self rather than living a reprobated life.

Ultimately, I wouldn't feel complete in my Human Life without having a Son or a Daughter, and giving back to the world that allowed me to live such a bountiful life. I urge people to critically reflect every year about the direction of their lives and make sure that you are aligned with your purpose in whatever stage of life you are currently in, whether that be a 20 year old in college (me) or a 45 year old divorcee.

The issue is that newbies take many posts  (especially the angry ones that they relate to) at face value. People need to understand that this is TRP *Theory* not *law*. Nothing is an absolute. TRP is not to be read as a manual to life, it is moreso a guidebook. It is a good source of information to set you in the right direction but not to dictate exactly how you live your life. 

Why is it not good to expect to have TRP tell you exactly how you should live? Simply because life is so complex that no generic tips or advice will apply to every person reading it. Everyone is different. Life is precious and limited just try to enjoy it while it lasts. Redpill can increase your quality of life, but like all other things in life it is used best in moderation.

I know I'm an outlier.

I enjoy downvote brigades because i know 2-3 guys will take a step past the bullshit and realize you can live your life by your own rules. Not society, not the church, not your neighbor. What do you want?

So go for it. Whats stopping you?

What is in the way of you living your life the way you want to live your life?

I’m new to the red pill and I’m using the way in normal life like with woman at Work and girls I know 
It works 
You just have to read and make sure you apply what you learned in real life experience 
A woman is not the goal it’s something along the way with what comes with your new out look on life 
Don’t try and think you have frame then when a woman talks to you, you break and lose it 
Try hard to be with what you have in your mind and stay with it 
I am and it’s making my life better 
Go with your life and do what you want and don’t be a pussy and go with the flow when you don’t want to 
Follow your own path and stick with it

I agree 100% with you, I think most guys who talk badly about social media are 25+. When you're 14-21 it's almost obligatory to have good social media, otherwise people automatically relate you to the loser nerds and assume you have an uninteresting life. Social media is a tool like any other.

18081
I will agree with some of the statements about social media and the sentiment about it, but I'm not entirely sure that not having social media is very beneficial. I'm very new to TRP still so I'm willing to believe I might be wrong about that. 

Depending on who you are it might be "creepy" to not have social media, but you're probably already a "creepy" person if anyone thinks that just because you delete your accounts. I think that social media may be permissible if you don't show all of your cards on it (again, I might be wrong here). My social media accounts are set up is in a way that pretty much only major life events (graduating college, getting a job in my field, etc.) and things others (family and friends) tag me in are being posted. At least in my mind, anyone who sees my accounts should be able to tell pretty quickly that there's much more going on outside of me getting my degree X amount of years ago. Also, I have pretty much only family, close friends, and some people from high school (who i'm mainly watching to see how bad it all inevitably goes); anyone who annoys the fuck out of me, attention whores, posts political/religious things without appearing to understand their own argument, etc get deleted.

I will admit there are some exes/old flings that follow me that I need to go through and purge, but I don't think social media should be vilified in such an absolute, all or nothing way.

&gt;In some ways I have high SMV because I am conventionally attractive, have a good physique from weights,running and swimming, a high paying job in robotics/AI, am well educated, well read, traveled, dress well, groom well, can carry conversations without being dull, a doormat, etc. 

that's not really high SMV. it's more like normal standard stuff for everyone who isn't a complete fuckup. 

and don't forget all the big negatives you have that are bringing down your SMV:
- no friends
- no girls chasing you / lack of abundance
- no social life
- weak social skills 

there are a lot of guys like you. you never learned how to make friends or socialize. all of the friends you've  had in the past were people forced to be in regular proximity with you for other reasons (children of your parents' friends, other kids in your neighborhood, classmates, people living in your dorm in college, coworkers, etc). you don't understand that out in the real world, social connections don't just happen, you have to make them happen.

as you get older, it becomes harder to sit back and passively rely on the social environment to create friendships just because people are trapped in the same room as you for several hours a day, 5 days a week.

if you want to stop being a social loser, you need to learn how to approach people, cultivate relationships with them, and develop social connections that aren't based on random proximity. you have to start being active, not passive.

I personally think that caring too much about social media can actually lead to lacking of social awareness. Sure, social proof is one of the most effective ways to prove that you are socially adept, and social media is the easiest way to frame your social proof. In reality though it is staged. For example, the 300 like profile picture the chick put up last night will prove that people think shes attractive and it will help her attract male attention. But this has absolutely nothing to do with her social awareness, because when you talk to her in real life she sounds like a potato. I just think social media is overrated and unnecessary but if you use it properly and with a grounded mind it can be useful. You aren't out of touch because you opt out though.

&gt; I believe for a relationship to be successful you have to be 1-2 points higher than her in SMV

I would suggest it's that she **must believe** you are 1-2 points higher in SMV.  
If you aren't, but she believes you are, that works fine.  
If you are, but she doesn't see it anymore, then you're done.

8306
I guess that begs another question; is it better to lead a social circle of lower SMV males than it is to be lower value in a higher SMV group? I personally believe i am the best looking between all my friends (tall, fashionable, only one who lifts) but i feel its hard to establish a position within the group. I also find it hard to just join a new social circle if I dont know where to start looking.

5893
I agree. My comment was because if you don't have social media you're either really high value that you don't need to or very low because you're scared of what people think about you. If you're average and dont have social media people are gonna assume your the latter.

Obviously don't revolve your life around it just make sure your not seen as creepy, weird or unpopular.

I was a teenager like 4 years ago, and none of the ‘cool’ kids had social media. Aside from Instagrams they occasionally posted on of them at social events. Unless that has changed recently or maybe that was just something in my area I think it’s completely fine. I was on the football team at a very football centric school, and most of us didn’t have social media or at least rarely used it. No one really gave a fuck if you had social media or not, at worst someone might ask about something that happened. Then you would say ‘oh I don’t have X social media’ they would be like ‘what the fuuuuck??’ and then explain what happened and it wasn’t spoken of again.

except that this little flip flop thing misleads the reader.

most [alpha] men do not feel dread.  alphas understand that she is not his... it is just his turn, outcome independence, dngaf, etc.  men derive value from a woman's intrinsic values... her fertility, sexuality, chastity, homemaking skills, loyalty, etc.  even then, men are not picky.  practically any female with a hole is good enough for a short term fling.  her increasing her SMV gets him more aroused, not jealous.

in contrast, women are extrinsic social drug addicts.  they need social validation from the female social matrix like a hit of heroine.  from a man, they need him to have high value so that she can show him off to her friends.  and guys with status, even if they're intrinsically terrible people (e.g. wife beater celebrities), are still high value that women chase after because their social value is high enough.  hypergamy requires not only that a woman date up in social caste, but also more alpha than all previous mates.  when a guy dreads a woman by increasing his SMV, she was already only with him because she thought he was the highest SMV guy she could get.  if she loses him, she has an even higher bar to meet, and she knows how much anguish she'll feel for dating a guy of lower SMV.  but what she really wants to do is wear sweatpants and get fat.  she *dreads* this feeling.

side note: if you're dating a girl and haven't met many of her friends, and you're not in her social media pictures, she does not view you as alpha.  she feels she is settling for you and is ashamed to show you off.  she only wants you for your resources.

18594
Yeah, he does do better actually.

The silent stoic kid likely wouldn't be nearly as popular, therefore less social opportunities and lays. 

Sure you want to create an air of mystery but just because you have social media it doesn't mean you can't still do that. 

The younger you are, the weirder it is if you don't have social media. Think as you like, but behave like others. 

Social media is also instant social proof.

The point is, men actually love women.  Women don't love men, they only love the feelings that the man gives her.  Once those feelings are gone (I love you but I'm not IN love with you), then she couldnt care less if that man got hit by a truck.  Many many women in counselling have uttered those exact words.  "My life would be better if he just didnt wake up one morning".

3458
No, I think a woman can "love" a beta but her love is based on what he provides for her and quite frankly how sexually satisfying he is.  If he no longer gives her these things, she no longer loves him.  Its not the loyal, til death do us part love that men and dogs are capable of.

This list is a bit silly. Have you ever been in a relationship?

&gt;Never ever tell her that you love her deeply, never write too romantic letters , messages etc.

&gt; Want to express love? Say 'I like you' and stop don't glorify love too much. Women are romantic but internally in their imagination not outside.

These will make a women leave you for emotional unavailability. Read Sex God Method.

EDIT: The answer here is to say 1/3 less than her. She says "I love you". Ok, cuddle her. She says "I love you" again. Say her name like "Allice!" with a smile. She says "I love you" a third time or "I love you so much", say I love you back.

But it's definitely not never.

EDIT2: Ok, this list is the hardcore list of "The do's and don'ts if you want her to be in a relationship with you". If you tone down each point, it's somewhat useful.

The ancient poet, Ovid, warned against this:  
  
**And then, how often it has happened that the man who begins by feigning love ends by falling in love in real earnest. Alas, my fair ones, look with indulgent eye on those that give themselves a lover's airs; the love, now feigned, will soon be love indeed.**

I think you're probably a smart, decent guy who's at least somewhat attractive and you get by pretty well by following the standard societal norms regarding dating and all that.

I may have misjudged your beliefs, but I think you've also misjudged this subreddit. We understand love exists. But we don't think love is the end-game that should be pursued, the highest ideal to aim for, like most people today believe. Instead, most of us like to have a lot of sex, usually with multiple women. So we don't really care much about love. It's cool if women love us, but it's only optional, and same with us loving them. And when we do love a woman it's not important to show it, because doing so rarely increases the amount of sex we have, and in many cases it actually decreases the amount of sex we have. In a few cases showing your affection in a strong way can be beneficial, and some of us do that and have success with it.

I think the main difference between us here is that you want to love and be loved. I want to fuck, a LOT, and whether there is also love present or not isn't important to me. Either we have different values, or one of us is lying to ourselves about our true values.

I'm not saying she loves me the way I do I love her because I like loving her, she is not the only one I love though. I'm not committing away from love just because bitches do not know how to do it themselves. 

She gives me what I want when I'm with her and at those times I know she loves me when I'm away that's her own business I just do not worry about it. I take what I like from her and so does she, is she an unicorn? Hell no I know that I'm not delusional, and because I'm not delusional I can enjoy what I like while I have it. No need to be angry pal.

&gt; "No matter what, I'll love you."

Actually, that is a tactic on his part. Women always act like "love" matters (like when I tell women I probably shouldn't have married my wife, but I was dumb, they always say "but you did because you loved her?"). He will love her. Love her enough to dump her ass for cheating is what I would mean, and I hope its what he means too.

Men love women. Women love children. Children love puppies.

Yeah you "love" your parent but they truly unconditionally love you. They sacrificed their youth, unspoken hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring you to 18. Yeah sure you love them but if you look deep in your heart it's a love of their love and attention and resources towards you. Most people I know talk with their parents once a month and even then it's a chore, they rush it and mostly talk about themselves.

The problem is contingent on not only the way in which man craves to be loved, but likewise the way in which woman is capable of loving. Man desires a sacrificial love, sacrifice implies loyalty and connection. What men want from love, and what woman’s love amounts to is fundamentally irreconcilable.

In matters of love (and not simply lust,) man is an optimistic egalitarian. He loves as he wishes to be loved. In matters of love, when man is young and oblivious to the ways of women, he is a true adherent of the golden rule.

The folly of man’s nature lies in the belief that the loyalty quintessential to woman’s maternal instinct will be available within a romantic context. He believes rather foolishly, that as his mother loved him, the idealised girlfriend could. He sees how women love their children, and upon making such an observation concludes that women are capable of great love. This is true, they are. Only sadly, this great love is a love reserved solely for children, it extends not to man. As such, man has an idealisation of woman’s love, not a realisation.

Man desires that which is unattainable to him, unaware the love he desires is maternal in nature, unable to be felt for him. Nature plays a cruel trick on the psychology of man. It gives him a very pure, high quality love in his childhood. It gives him a template for woman’s love that he comes to expect as standard of all women. He is taught by his mother’s love that unconditional loyalty, noble character, gentleness, sacrifice and trust are intrinsic of the feminine essence. And so as he grows from a boy into a man he comes to the rather logical conclusion that if he is “a good man,” he can expect to be loved by his lover in much the same way. His mother, well-meant but quite incorrectly likewise affirms this notion to him. This is a wicked lie, but a man whose heart is yet to be broken does not realise this. He thinks woman’s love is immutable. He knows not that her love for child is different from that of her love for him.

And so man longs to be loved like a child, not realising such a love is reserved for children. Believing that the love he covets is romantic love, when truly it is maternal love. Such a man of course lacks the experience or nuance of mind to make this distinction. And so the tragedy for this man is learning that women do not love men like they love children. The unconditional loyalty inherent to the maternal bond is all but absent from the mating bond. Most men do not realise this. They love wholesomely right up until they are emotionally blind-sided by a woman in the most violable of ways, forced to re-evaluate their opinion of female nature. This is not a hypothetical so much as it is an eventuality. If lucky, post-breakup they end up on this site or elsewhere similar.

From there on, man can learn to re-evaluate his notion of woman’s capacity to love. He will come to learn woman’s love for her mate is of vastly reduced moral and psychological quality than that of her love for her child. How he responds to such powerful knowledge will ultimately shape what kind of man he decides to become. Be it a man going his own way, a disillusioned bachelor looking to use women for nothing but sex, or a patriarch who runs his house like a business, aware of the risk, but acting in all his power to mitigate it.

However cruel as it may seem, women are incapable of reciprocating man’s love. They love differently. There is a hierarchy of love that trickles down. Man sacrifices for woman, and woman, for child. Rarely does the river flow upward. As such, if man is to believe that women can love to the same extent as he, then he is doomed to disappointment and misery when she invariably acts within accordance of her nature rather than his idealisation.

Woman’s Love Defined: The epitome of a woman’s love is infatuation. To define it, this is a lust for your power and an obsession with how your character makes her feel, secondary to your power. It is put crudely: opportunism and emotional self-appeasement alchemised with lust.

Man oft forgets that love does not flow upward in the sacrificial sense. He makes the mistake of thinking that because he can love a woman without lusting for her, that a woman can do the same. She cannot, because her love is not based on sacrifice, it is based on the appreciation of man’s sacrifice met with lust. The more man sacrifices for a woman, the more likely he is to fall in love with his investment. The more a woman sacrifices for man absent of animal lust, the more repulsion she feels for him, interpreting her need for investment as a shortcoming on his part. And so there it is, unspoken in word but detected in sentiment; woman expects man to love her more than she loves him, reinforcing the hierarchy of love. Female sacrifice is predicated on lust and mental entrapment. Male sacrifice is expected, and freely given.

Love &amp; Female Self-Deception: A woman who does not lust for you cannot love you as you wish to be loved. Lust is the basis for her love, absent of lust you have “like” rather than “love.” Such a woman can do naught but use you and lie to you both that she is in love when she isn’t. If it is convenient for a woman to be in love, she will convince herself she is in love so that she may convince you of it. Women are masters of self-deception, so one must be extremely cautious in assigning any substance to their convictions. Treat such earnest emotional conviction as sophistry. Women are generally speaking, emotionally neurotic. Women who become too self-aware can end up hating themselves because they cannot overcome their animal elements.

&gt; You can never be sure, she actually loves you and is not settling for you.

No woman will love you the way you want them to love you.  This should never be a consideration.
