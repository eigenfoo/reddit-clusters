Really? This is the future WOMEN as a whole chose? I'm pretty sure not all women thought that trans women should be able to compete in women's sports.

This is untrue. Stong women on testosterons or trangender women can easly over power a wheelchair manscum and force reproduction. 

Edit: i know a tran wpman could only get impregnated by transnwoman or vwomyn.

"I look like a woman, and someone mistook me for a woman, and I was embarrassed because I am not a woman, therefore I know what it's like to be a woman"

Did I read this right

My fave is when the dispatcher asks (I'm assuming) the clothes she's wearing and he goes "black" and immediately a defensive "I'm not black I'm not black"

It takes all the colors to make a rainbow. Well... except for blacks. We don't have blacks in the rainbow.

She also specified in the books that Dean Thomas was black, as well as Sycophantic Slytherin #3 in HBP. Why wouldn’t she specify Hermy as black if she was meant to be?

There are some people that believe black people can treat other black people however they want and because they're both black it's okay. Just had this someone tell me this the other day.

I can't speak for everybody, but I use this place as a way to get the hell away from Reddit and the MSM reports of "Trump feeds koi!" "Trump ate his fried chicken with a fork and knife!" "Trump says illegal immigrants are breaking the law!" "The former security manager of Trump's friend's wife allegedly met with Putin!", and so on. The media is so overblown with Trump because they know it appeals to a certain demographic. I don't care if people post about trump, but it's almost always cringey to me because they try to make it excessively anti-trump, so you just go from something mildly political and funny, to something excessively political full of dogma and no humor. Every time I see a trump post, it feels like it was made on Facebook.

This isn't a trump sub, it just isn't as anti trump as the rest of Reddit. And as we now know, you're either with trump or against him. No middle ground, according to Reddit.

Ok from my understanding it’s like this:  
If your racist against people of color: racist  
That ones obvious  
If you say your not racist: racist  
We all know it’s ingrained into your mind fool  
If you unlearn your racist history and try to be a good person all around: racist  
Ok buckaroo your trying way to hard to not be racist to a point where it’s racist.   
You are racist 100% of the time you white scum.

This sub is a cesspool. Reddit doesn't have c**ntown or fatpeoplehate anymore so all the racist neckbeards converge in here and TiA.

> Having sex with a man once or twice to see what it's like or because someone offered you money for it doesn't make you gay. 

That's the funniest shit I've read all day. Bravo!

Also, the distinction between bisexual and gay is academic. If you do a gay thing, you have done a gay thing. That's what "being gay" means to a LOT of people. Redefining it is as useful as all the other things SJWs are redefining.

And, yes, someone can be gay and have never had sex with anyone. But, if they have gay sex, they can never be 100% not gay (unless it was a situation without freely granted consent, but that is supposed to go without saying in polite company).

I mean, seriously, try putting that on your online dating profile. "I'm a straight guy who likes girls but I did let a guy fuck me once to see what it was like."

We can quibble over the philosophical definitions of "being gay" versus "engaging in gay behaviours" but that's not really a very useful thing to do. I'm conflating "being gay" with "engaging in gay behaviours" for precisely that reason. If you really have a problem with me equating those two concepts, we must agree to disagree, but at least I'll understand where you're coming from.

Another thing that ought to go without saying is that at no point did I offer a value judgement. In case it's not obvious, I never said "engaging in gay behaviours is morally wrong." My assertion is that, at least for a lot of people (many of whom are highly educated), homosexual behaviours that are voluntarily engaged in are *gay acts* and someone who does that can be described as a bit gay, formerly gay, bisexual (which is gay, because in this way of using the term, gayness is about gay behaviours, and heterosexual behaviours do not cancel it out in some kind of bizarre sexual zero-sum game). "Gay for pay" is still gay, it's right there in the term.

I get that you mean something actually different when you say "gay" but a great deal of people do not make that distinction.

*Being* gay is the act of doing gay things. I've heard of it being faked, but if you're actually penetrating/being penetrated, yes, you are gay. Even if you don't like it. You are voluntarily in the situtation, you *consented* freely, so you are doing gay things and that makes you gay. Once you stop doing gay things you could become "formerly gay," but you can never, ever again be "not at all gay." Even if you keep it secret, it's still true.
